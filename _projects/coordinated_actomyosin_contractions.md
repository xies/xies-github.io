## Pulsatile actin-myosin contractions fold tissues

During _Drosophila_ gastrulation, around 1,200 mesoderm cells collectively contract
to form a fold in the tissue. The force necessary for this morphogenesis
is (partly) generated by actin-myosin contractions at the apical surfaces of the
mesoderm cells.

These actin-myosin contractions are _pulsatile_, meaning they occur in discrete
steps, driven by the phosphorylation dynamics of myosin; each pulse of myosin activation
leads to a discrete constriction of the cell apical surface.

## How are discrete pulses spatiotemporally coordinated?
