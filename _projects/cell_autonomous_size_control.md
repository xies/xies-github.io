## I study how cells keep to the same size

Size is one of the most fundamental parameters of a cell. Yet, we do not
understand what sets a cell's size, and once cells are formed, how they
maintain that size over time.

## What we knew (about yeast) and didn't know (about mammals)

Budding yeast cells coordinate their G1-to-S cell cycle transition to cell size.
Two cells that were born at different sizes end up more similar in size as they
enter S phase. {}

However, despite more than a decade of research, it was unclear whether mammalian
cells coupled their cell cycle progression to their cell growth in quite the same
way.

I set out to develop an <a href="https://xies.github.io/projects/2_project/">experimental
system</a> in which we can study cell size homeostasis in an _in vivo_ animal.

## The G1/S transition _in vivo_ is sensitive to cell size

By analyzing how single cells grow _in vivo_, I found that cells that are born
smaller spend longer in G1 phase compared to larger born cells. This is so that
they can grow much more than their larger-born neighbors.

This coordination between

## The G1/S transition happens at an autonomously-encoded cell size threshold


## Variation in reaching the G1/S cell size threshold accounts for >70% of stem cell cycle heterogeneity
