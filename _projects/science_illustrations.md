    Since the Skotheim lab uses a variety of methods and model systems to study cell size,
    different people's day-to-day workshorse equipment could be quite different. The one
    item that united us all, however, was the humble
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulter_counter">Coulter counter</a>, a machine
    that does two things exceedingly well: count cells and measure their volume. I painted
    a portrait of our resident Coulter counter, alongside its trusted friend, the blue
    maintenance solution that we all called "blue stuff."

      When my friend <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/vasquezlab/">Claudia VÃ¡squez</a> left from Stanford
      to start her lab at University of Washington, studying how simple epithelial shapes like
      folds and tubes further organize in 3D into more complex shapes, I painted for her a cartoon of her
      model system of interest, the _Drosophlia_ Malpighian tubule cells.
