## tubular cells
When my friend <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/vasquezlab/">Claudia VÃ¡squez</a> left from Stanford
to start her lab at University of Washington, studying how simple epithelial shapes like
folds and tubes further organize in 3D into more complex shapes, I painted for her a cartoon of her
model system of interest, the <i>Drosophlia</i> Malpighian tubule cells.

## cover art

      My colleague <a href="https://swafferlab.co.uk/">Matthew Swaffer</a> had found the mechanism by which yeast
      cells synthesize a protein Whi5 in a way that "subscaled" with cell size: as cells grew larger, it did not make more of it, allowing Whi5 to dilute. There are also proteins that "superscale" with size: the cell had more of these proteins as it grew larger. The Skotheim lab had found a large gradient of these different "scaling" behaviors across the whole genome.

## portraits of scientific equipment

Since the Skotheim lab uses a variety of methods and model systems to study cell size,
different people's day-to-day workhorse equipment could be quite different. The one
item that united us all, however, was the humble
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulter_counter">Coulter counter</a>, a machine
that does two things exceedingly well: count cells and measure their volume. I painted
a portrait of our resident Coulter counter, alongside its trusted friend, the blue
maintenance solution that we all called "blue stuff."

These images eventually were made into a Skotheim lab hoodie.
