Stanford's Department of Biology hosts a Pumpkin Fest every year on Halloween. For 2023, I decided to
create portrait of a typical lab meeting framed as a parody of da Vinci's _The Last Supper_.

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/art/pumpkin1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Several of the Skotheim lab members are represented, including the beloved lab dog, Coco, who has jumped
on top of the conference room table -- presumably to beg for pizza.
