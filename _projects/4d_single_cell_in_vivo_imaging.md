In order to study the _dynamics_ of cell growth and cell cycle progression in an adult animal,
I developed an experimental system to directly observe and track single cells in a living mouse,
over long periods of time.


## Intravital imaging of mouse skin

The methods to image mouse cells were pioneered by [Valentina Greco](https://www.grecolab.org/lab-members)'s group,
who established protocols to perform the longitudinal re-imaging of the same tissue regions,
and has made available many reporter mouse lines generated by her group.

This powerful technique uses two-photon microscopy, which can penetrate deeper
into tissues compared to single-photon excitation, to image fluorescent mouse lines that express
reporters for cellular structures (e.g. nucleus, cell boundary) and cell states (e.g.
  cell cycle phase, cell type). This produces three-dimensional stacks of images
  a small voxel of the living epidermis, from outside to the basalmost layer.

During imaging, the animal is anesthetized to prevent it from moving. I then use various
landmarking techniques to navigate back to the same exact tissue region in the same mouse
over many imaging sessions. The mouse then is allowed to return to its normal housing
and activity in between imaging sessions.

This technique can collect time-lapsed '3D snapshots' of the same piece of skin tissue
over many days. The longest I have done so far is daily snapshot for 10 days.

## Computational analysis: alignment

Although we have these 3D snapshots of the same region, they are not pixel-perfect. There are always
slight variations in position and angle from timepoint to timepoint. Therefore, I built tools
