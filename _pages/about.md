I am a quantitative cell biologist interested in how cells and tissues
"remember" how large they are supposed to be, even though they are being constantly
generated and replaced in our adult bodies. I use intravital imaging
to follow hundreds of adult stem cells over many days as they grow inside
a living mouse.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the lab of <a href='https://skotheimlab.com/'>Jan Skotheim</a> at Stanford University,
in the Department of Biology.

I received my PhD in <a href="https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb">Computational and Systems Biology</a> from MIT,
studying how individual cells coordinate
their actin-myosin contractions (which apply force on their neighbors) to smoothly
fold a large connected sheet of epithelium. Before this, I studied physics and applied mathematics at UC Berkeley.
