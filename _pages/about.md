I am a quantitative biologist. I am interested in how cells and tissues
"remember" how large they are supposed to be, even though they are being constantly
replaced in our adult bodies. I use intravital imaging of mouse skin
to follow single adult stem cells as they grow in the mammalian body over
days and weeks.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the lab of Jan Skotheim at Stanford University,
in the Department of Biology.

I received my PhD in <a href="https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb">Computational and Systems Biology</a> from MIT, studying how individual cells coordinate
their actin-myosin contractions (which apply force on their neighbors) to smoothly
fold a large connected sheet of epithelium. I used <em>in vivo</em> imaging,
computer vision, and spatial statistics, to uncover how neighboring cells
are coupled. Before this, I studied physics and applied mathematics at UC Berkeley.
