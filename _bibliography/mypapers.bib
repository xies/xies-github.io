	abstract = {Absolute protein quantification using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics delivers protein concentrations or copy numbers per cell. Existing methodologies typically require a combination of isotope-labeled spike-in references, cell counting, and protein concentration measurements. Here we present a novel method that delivers similar quantitative results directly from deep eukaryotic proteome datasets without any additional experimental steps. We show that the MS signal of histones can be used as a "proteomic ruler" because it is proportional to the amount of DNA in the sample, which in turn depends on the number of cells. As a result, our proteomic ruler approach adds an absolute scale to the MS readout and allows estimation of the copy numbers of individual proteins per cell. We compare our protein quantifications with values derived via the use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and protein epitope signature tags in a method that combines spike-in protein fragment standards with precise isotope label quantification. The proteomic ruler approach yields quantitative readouts that are in remarkably good agreement with results from the precision method. We attribute this surprising result to the fact that the proteomic ruler approach omits error-prone steps such as cell counting or protein concentration measurements. The proteomic ruler approach is readily applicable to any deep eukaryotic proteome dataset-even in retrospective analysis-and we demonstrate its usefulness with a series of mouse organ proteomes.},

These multipotent bulge SCs were initially identified as slow cycling label retaining cells; however, their isolation has been made feasible after identification of specific cell markers, such as CD34 and keratin 15 (K15). Here, we describe a robust method for isolating bulge SCs and epidermal keratinocytes from mouse HFs utilizing fluorescence activated cell-sorting (FACS) technology.

In budding yeast, buffering gene expression against this imbalance depends on marking replicated DNA by H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac). Whether additional processes are required for suppressing transcription from H3K56ac-labeled DNA remains unknown. Here, using a database-guided candidate screen, we find that COMPASS, the H3K4 methyltransferase, and its upstream effector, PAF1C, act downstream of H3K56ac to buffer expression. Replicated genes show reduced abundance of the transcription activating mark H3K4me3 and accumulate the transcription inhibitory mark H3K4me2 near transcription start sites. Notably, in hydroxyurea-exposed cells, the S phase checkpoint stabilizes H3K56ac and becomes essential for buffering. We suggest that H3K56ac suppresses transcription of replicated genes by interfering with post-replication recovery of epigenetic marks and assign a new function for the S phase checkpoint in stabilizing this mechanism during persistent dosage imbalance.},

By directing septin-mediated compartmentalization of cortical actomyosin, PCP proteins coordinate the specific shortening of mesenchymal cell-cell contacts, which in turn powers cell interdigitation.

Here, we show that dPTEN, a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian PTEN tumor suppressor gene, plays an essential role in the control of cell size, cell number, and organ size. In mosaic animals, dPTEN(-) cells proliferate faster than their heterozygous siblings, show an autonomous increase in cell size, and form organs of increased size, whereas overexpression of dPTEN results in opposite phenotypes. The loss-of-function phenotypes of dPTEN are suppressed by mutations in the PI3K target Dakt1 and the translational initiation factor eif4A, suggesting that dPTEN acts through the PI3K signaling pathway to regulate translation. Although activation of PI3K and Akt has been reported to increase rates of cellular growth but not proliferation, loss of dPTEN stimulates both of these processes, suggesting that PTEN regulates overall growth through PI3K/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways. Furthermore, we show that dPTEN does not play a major role in cell survival during Drosophila development. Our results provide a potential explanation for the high frequency of PTEN mutation in human cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Nuclear genome size varies 300 000-fold, whereas transcriptome size varies merely 17-fold. In the largest genomes nearly all DNA is non-genic secondary DNA, mostly intergenic but also within introns. There is now compelling evidence that secondary DNA is functional, i.e. positively selected by organismal selection, not the purely neutral or 'selfish' outcome of mutation pressure. The skeletal DNA theory argued that nuclear volumes are genetically determined primarily by nuclear DNA amounts, modulated somewhat by genes affecting the degree of DNA packing or unfolding; the huge spread of nuclear genome sizes is the necessary consequence of the origin of the nuclear envelope and the nucleation of its assembly by DNA, plus the adaptively significant 300 000-fold range of cell volumes and selection for balanced growth by optimizing karyoplasmic volume ratios (essentially invariant with cell volume in growing/multiplying cells). This simple explanation of the C-value paradox is refined here in the light of new insights into the nature of heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina, the genetic control of cell volume, and large-scale eukaryote phylogeny, placing special emphasis on protist test cases of the basic principles of nuclear genome size evolution. GENOME MINIATURIZATION:and Expansion Intracellular parasites (e.g. Plasmodium, microsporidia) dwarfed their genomes by gene loss and eliminating virtually all secondary DNA. The primary driving forces for genome reduction are metabolic and spatial economy and cell multiplication speed. Most extreme nuclear shrinkage yielded genomes as tiny as 0.38 Mb (making the nuclear genome size range effectively 1.8 million-fold!) in some minute enslaved nuclei (nucleomorphs) of cryptomonads and chlorarachneans, chimaeric cells that also retain a separate normal large nucleus. The latter shows typical correlation between genome size and cell volume, but nucleomorphs do not despite co-existing in the same cell for {\textgreater}500 My. Thus mutation pressure does not inexorably increase genome size; selection can eliminate essentially all non-coding DNA if need be. Nucleomorphs and microsporidia even reduced gene size. Expansion of secondary DNA in the main nucleus, and in large-celled eukaryotes generally, must be positively selected for function. Ciliate nuclear dimorphism provides a key test that refutes the selfish DNA and strongly supports the skeletal DNA/karyoplasmic ratio interpretation of genome size evolution. GENETIC CONTROL OF CELL VOLUME IS MULTIGENIC:The quantitatively proportional correlation between genome size and cell size cannot be explained by purely mutational theories, as eukaryote cell volumes are causally determined by cell cycle control genes, not by DNA amounts.},

Recent advancements in our understanding of mRNA decay have revealed a tight coupling between ribosome dynamics and the stability of mRNA transcripts; this coupling integrates codon bias into the concept of codon optimality, or the effects that specific codons and tRNA concentrations have on the efficiency and fidelity of the translation machinery. In this Review, we first discuss the evidence for codon-dependent effects on translation, beginning with the basic mechanisms through which translation perturbation can affect translation efficiency, protein folding and transcript stability. We then discuss how codon effects are leveraged by the cell to tailor the proteome to maintain homeostasis, execute specific gene expression programmes of growth or differentiation and optimize the efficiency of protein production.},

When mixed in hanging drop culture, their cells segregate into discrete phases with ectoderm adopting an internal position relative to the mesendoderm. The position adopted directly correlates with differences in tissue surface tension. We also show that germ layer tissues from untreated embryos, when extirpated and placed in culture, adopt a configuration similar to those of their mRNA-overexpressing counterparts. Down-regulating E-cadherin expression in the ectoderm leads to reduced surface tension and results in phase reversal with E-cadherin-depleted ectoderm cells now adopting an external position relative to the mesendoderm. These results show that in vitro cell sorting of zebrafish mesendoderm and ectoderm tissues is specified by tissue interfacial tensions. We perform a mathematical analysis indicating that tissue interfacial tension between actively motile cells contributes to the spatial organization and dynamics of these zebrafish germ layers in vivo.},

	abstract = {The absence of tools for mapping the forces that drive morphogenetic movements in embryos has impeded our understanding of animal development. Here we describe a unique approach, video force microscopy (VFM), that allows detailed, dynamic force maps to be produced from time-lapse images. The forces at work in an embryo are considered to be decomposed into active and passive elements, where active forces originate from contributions (e.g., actomyosin contraction) that do mechanical work to the system and passive ones (e.g., viscous cytoplasm) that dissipate energy. In the present analysis, the effects of all passive components are considered to be subsumed by an effective cytoplasmic viscosity, and the driving forces are resolved into equivalent forces along the edges of the polygonal boundaries into which the region of interest is divided. Advanced mathematical inverse methods are used to determine these driving forces. When applied to multiphoton sections of wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster embryos, VFM is able to calculate the equivalent driving forces acting along individual cell edges and to do so with subminute temporal resolution. In the wild type, forces along the apical surface of the presumptive mesoderm are found to be large and to vary parabolically with time and angular position, whereas forces along the basal surface of the ectoderm, for example, are found to be smaller and nearly uniform with position. VFM shows that in mutants with reduced junction integrity and myosin II activity, the driving forces are reduced, thus accounting for ventral furrow failure.},

Consequently, the level of Ki67 during G0 and G1 in individual cells is highly heterogeneous and depends on how long an individual cell has spent in G0. Thus, Ki67 is a graded rather than a binary marker both for cell-cycle progression and time since entry into quiescence. Ki67 is one of the most widely used markers of proliferation in oncology. Contrary to its canonical use as a binary marker of proliferation versus quiescence, Miller et al. find that Ki67 levels decay steadily in quiescent cells, which may enable more advanced clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a simple, robust, yet powerful approach in mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. SILAC labels cellular proteomes through normal metabolic processes, incorporating non-radioactive, stable isotope-containing amino acids in newly synthesized proteins. Growth medium is prepared where natural ("light") amino acids are replaced by "heavy" SILAC amino acids. Cells grown in this medium incorporate the heavy amino acids after five cell doublings and SILAC amino acids have no effect on cell morphology or growth rates. When light and heavy cell populations are mixed, they remain distinguishable by MS, and protein abundances are determined from the relative MS signal intensities. SILAC provides accurate relative quantification without any chemical derivatization or manipulation and enables development of elegant functional assays in proteomics. In this protocol, we describe how to apply SILAC and the use of nano-scale liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for protein identification and quantification. This procedure can be completed in 8 days.},

	abstract = {Primary mouse hepatocytes are an important tool in the biomedical research field for the assessment of hepatocyte function. Several methods for hepatocyte isolation have been published; however, many of these methods require extensive handling and can therefore compromise the viability and function of the isolated cells. Since one advantage of utilizing freshly isolated cells is to maintain an environment in which the cells are more comparable to their in vivo state, it is important to have robust methods that produce cells with high viability, good purity and that function in a similar manner to that in their in vivo state. Here we describe a modified two-step method for the rapid isolation and characterization of mouse primary hepatocytes that results in high yields of viable cells. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is one of the most abundant cell surface receptors on hepatocytes, was used to monitor the function of the isolated hepatocytes by demonstrating specific binding of its ligand using a newly developed flow cytometry based ligand-receptor binding assay. Also, an in vitro screening method for siRNA drug candidates was successfully developed utilizing freshly isolated hepatocytes with minimum culture time.},

In recent years, progress has been made towards understanding how the distinct cell biological processes that together drive apical constriction are coordinated. These processes include the contraction of actin-myosin networks, which generates force, and the attachment of actin networks to cell-cell junctions, which allows forces to be transmitted between cells. Different cell types regulate contractility and adhesion in unique ways, resulting in apical constriction with varying dynamics and subcellular organizations, as well as a variety of resulting tissue shape changes. Understanding both the common themes and the variations in apical constriction mechanisms promises to provide insight into the mechanics that underlie tissue morphogenesis. © 2014.

	abstract = {The directed migration of cell collectives drives the formation of complex organ systems. A characteristic feature of many migrating collectives is a 'tissue-scale' polarity, whereby 'leader' cells at the edge of the tissue guide trailing 'followers' that become assembled into polarised epithelial tissues en route. Here, we combine quantitative imaging and perturbation approaches to investigate epithelial cell state transitions during collective migration and organogenesis, using the zebrafish lateral line primordium as an in vivo model. A readout of three-dimensional cell polarity, based on centrosomal-nucleus axes, allows the transition from migrating leaders to assembled followers to be quantitatively resolved for the first time in vivo. Using live reporters and a novel fluorescent protein timer approach, we investigate changes in cell-cell adhesion underlying this transition by monitoring cadherin receptor localisation and stability. This reveals that while cadherin 2 is expressed across the entire tissue, functional apical junctions are first assembled in the transition zone and become progressively more stable across the leader-follower axis of the tissue. Perturbation experiments demonstrate that the formation of these apical adherens junctions requires dynamic microtubules. However, once stabilised, adherens junction maintenance is microtubule independent. Combined, these data identify a mechanism for regulating leader-to-follower transitions within migrating collectives, based on the relocation and stabilisation of cadherins, and reveal a key role for dynamic microtubules in this process. © 2014.

The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process that is controlled by the conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin protein complex 1 .

Here we demonstrate that p38 MAPK gamma (p38γ) acts as a CDK-like kinase and thus cooperates with CDKs, regulating entry into the cell cycle. p38γ shares high sequence homology, inhibition sensitivity and substrate specificity with CDK family members. In mouse hepatocytes, p38γ induces proliferation after partial hepatectomy by promoting the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein at known CDK target residues. Lack of p38γ or treatment with the p38γ inhibitor pirfenidone protects against the chemically induced formation of liver tumours. Furthermore, biopsies of human hepatocellular carcinoma show high expression of p38γ, suggesting that p38γ could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease.},

	abstract = {The Restriction Point was originally defined as the moment that cells commit to the cell cycle and was later suggested to coincide with hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Current cell cycle models posit that cells exit mitosis into a pre-Restriction Point state, where they have low cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and hypophosphorylated Rb; passage through the Restriction Point then occurs in late G1. Recent single-cell studies have challenged the current paradigm, raising questions about the location of the Restriction Point and the notion that cells exit mitosis into a pre-Restriction Point state. Here, we use a variety of single-cell techniques to show that both noncancer and cancer cells bifurcate into two subpopulations after anaphase, marked by increasing vs. low CDK2 activity and hyper- vs. hypophosphorylation of Rb. Notably, subpopulations with hyper- and hypophosphorylated Rb are present within minutes after anaphase, delineating one subpopulation that never "uncrosses" the Restriction Point and continues cycling and another subpopulation that exits mitosis into an uncommitted pre-Restriction Point state. We further show that the CDK inhibitor p21 begins rising in G2 in mother cells whose daughters exit mitosis into the pre-Restriction Point, CDK2low state. Furthermore, degradation of p21 coincides with escape from the CDK2low state and passage through the Restriction Point. Together, these data support a model in which only a subset of cells returns to a pre-Restriction Point state after mitosis and where the Restriction Point is sensitive to not only mitogens, but also inherited DNA replication stress via p21.},

Here, we provide a quantitative single-cell analysis of commitment dynamics during the mating-mitosis switch in budding yeast. Commitment to division corresponds precisely to activating the G1 cyclin positive feedback loop in competition with the cyclin inhibitor Far1. Cyclin-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of the mating pathway scaffold Ste5 are required to ensure exclusive expression of the mitotic transcriptional program after cell cycle commitment. Failure to commit exclusively results in coexpression of both cell cycle and pheromone-induced genes, and a morphologically mixed inviable cell fate. Thus, specification and maintenance of a cellular state are performed by distinct interactions, which are likely a consequence of disparate reaction rates and may be a general feature of the interlinked regulatory networks responsible for selecting cell fates.},

	abstract = {Cell size fundamentally affects all biosynthetic processes by determining the scale of organelles and influencing surface transport. Although extensive studies have identified many mutations affecting cell size, the molecular mechanisms underlying size control have remained elusive. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, size control occurs in G1 phase before Start, the point of irreversible commitment to cell division. It was previously thought that activity of the G1 cyclin Cln3 increased with cell size to trigger Start by initiating the inhibition of the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 (refs 6-8). Here we show that although Cln3 concentration does modulate the rate at which cells pass Start, its synthesis increases in proportion to cell size so that its total concentration is nearly constant during pre-Start G1. Rather than increasing Cln3 activity, we identify decreasing Whi5 activity–due to the dilution of Whi5 by cell growth–as a molecular mechanism through which cell size controls proliferation. Whi5 is synthesized in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a largely size-independent manner. This results in smaller daughter cells being born with higher Whi5 concentrations that extend their pre-Start G1 phase. Thus, at its most fundamental level, size control in budding yeast results from the differential scaling of Cln3 and Whi5 synthesis rates with cell size. More generally, our work shows that differential size-dependency of protein synthesis can provide an elegant mechanism to coordinate cellular functions with growth.},

	abstract = {We describe the quantitative monitoring of TATA-binding protein (TBP) localization and expression in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We replaced the endogenous TBP with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) x TBP fusion, which was imaged quantitatively by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). When GFP x TBP expression was altered by using various promoters, the levels measured by LSCM correlated well with the levels determined by immunoblot of whole cell extract protein. These results show that GFP x TBP imaging not only offers a method of measurement equivalent to a more conventional technique but also provides real-time quantitation in living cells and subcellular localization information. Time-lapse confocal imaging of GFP x TBP in mitotic yeast cells revealed that it remains localized to the nucleus and displays an asymmetric distribution (1:0.7) between mother and daughter cells. Based on this and data from a mutant which underexpresses GFP x TBP, we suggest that intracellular levels of TBP are near rate-limiting for growth and viability.},

	abstract = {© 2015, Tanenbaum et al. Passage through mitosis is driven by precisely-timed changes in transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. However, the importance of translational regulation during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we find both a global translational repression and identified ∼200 mRNAs that undergo specific translational regulation at mitotic entry. In contrast, few changes in mRNA abundance are observed, indicating that regulation of translation is the primary mechanism of modulating protein expression during mitosis. Interestingly, 91\% of the mRNAs that undergo gene-specific regulation in mitosis are translationally repressed, rather than activated. One of the most pronounced translationally-repressed genes is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) which is degraded during mitosis. We show that full APC activation requires translational repression of Emi1 in addition to its degradation. These results identify gene-specific translational repression as a means of controlling the mitotic proteome, which may complement post-translational mechanisms for inactivating protein function.},

	abstract = {Epithelial bending is a central feature of morphogenesis in animals. Here we show that mutual antagonism by the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and RhoA determines cell shape, tissue curvature, and invagination activity in the model epithelium of the developing mouse lens. The epithelial cells of the invaginating lens placode normally elongate and change from a cylindrical to an apically constricted, conical shape. RhoA mutant lens placode cells are both longer and less apically constricted than control cells, thereby reducing epithelial curvature and invagination. By contrast, Rac1 mutant lens placode cells are shorter and more apically restricted than controls, resulting in increased epithelial curvature and precocious lens vesicle closure. Quantification of RhoA- and Rac1-dependent pathway markers over the apical-basal axis of lens pit cells showed that in RhoA mutant epithelial cells there was a Rac1 pathway gain of function and vice versa. These findings suggest that mutual antagonism produces balanced activities of RhoA-generated apical constriction and Rac1-dependent cell elongation that controls cell shape and thus curvature of the invaginating epithelium. The ubiquity of the Rho family GTPases suggests that these mechanisms are likely to apply generally where epithelial morphogenesis occurs.},

	abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) involved in embryonic development, adult homeostasis, and disease. Over the past decade, several advances have been made in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based technologies to identify thousands of phosphorylation sites. However, in-depth phosphoproteomics often require off-line enrichment and fractionation techniques. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of phosphopeptides, which have been fractionated by off-line high-pH chromatography (HpH) before subsequent titanium dioxide (TiO2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. Our results demonstrate that HpH is superior to standard strong-cation exchange (SCX) fractionation in the total number of phosphopeptides detected when analyzing the same number of fractions by identical LC-MS/MS gradients. From 14 HpH fractions, we routinely identified over 30,000 unique phosphopeptide variants, which is more than twice the number of that obtained from SCX fractionation. HpH chromatography displayed an exceptional ability to fractionate singly phosphorylated peptides, with minor benefits for doubly phosphorylated peptides over that with SCX. Further optimizations in the pooling and concatenation strategy increased the total number of multiphosphorylated peptides detected after HpH fractionation. In conclusion, we provide a basic framework and resource for performing in-depth phosphoproteome studies utilizing off-line basic reversed-phased fractionation.

A better understanding of stem cell biology, including embryonic and adult stem cells, will allow the scientific community to better comprehend a number of pathologies and possibly design novel approaches to treat patients with a variety of diseases. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor RB controls the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells, and accumulating evidence points to a central role for RB activity in the biology of stem and progenitor cells. In some contexts, loss of RB function in stem or progenitor cells is a key event in the initiation of cancer and determines the subtype of cancer arising from these pluripotent cells by altering their fate. In other cases, RB inactivation is often not sufficient to initiate cancer but may still lead to some stem cell expansion, raising the possibility that strategies aimed at transiently inactivating RB might provide a novel way to expand functional stem cell populations. Future experiments dedicated to better understanding how RB and the RB pathway control a stem cell's decisions to divide, self-renew, or give rise to differentiated progeny may eventually increase our capacity to control these decisions to enhance regeneration or help prevent cancer development. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Therefore, the identification, characterization, and pharmacological elimination of senescent cells have gained attention in the field of aging research. However, the nonspecificity of current senescence markers and the existence of different senescence programs strongly limit these tasks. Here, we describe the molecular regulators of senescence phenotypes and how they are used for identifying senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. We also highlight the importance that these levels of regulations have in the development of therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Animal cells use an unknown mechanism to control their growth and physical size. Here, using the fluorescence exclusion method, we measure cell volume for adherent cells on substrates of varying stiffness. We discover that the cell volume has a complex dependence on substrate stiffness and is positively correlated with the size of the cell adhesion to the substrate. From a mechanical force-balance condition that determines the geometry of the cell surface, we find that the observed cell volume variation can be predicted quantitatively from the distribution of active myosin through the cell cortex. To connect cell mechanical tension with cell size homeostasis, we quantified the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, a transcription factor involved in cell growth and proliferation. We find that the level of nuclear YAP/TAZ is positively correlated with the average cell volume. Moreover, the level of nuclear YAP/TAZ is also connected to cell tension, as measured by the amount of phosphorylated myosin. Cells with greater apical tension tend to have higher levels of nuclear YAP/TAZ and a larger cell volume. These results point to a size-sensing mechanism based on mechanical tension: the cell tension increases as the cell grows, and increasing tension feeds back biochemically to growth and proliferation control.},

	abstract = {RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs) derived from the CRISPR/Cas system represent an efficient tool for genome editing. RGENs consist of two components: Cas9 protein and guide RNA. Plasmid-mediated delivery of these components into cells can result in uncontrolled integration of the plasmid sequence into the host genome, and unwanted immune responses and potential safety problems that can be caused by the bacterial sequences. Furthermore, this delivery method requires transfection tools. Here we show that simple treatment with cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-conjugated recombinant Cas9 protein and CPP-complexed guide RNAs leads to endogenous gene disruptions in human cell lines. The Cas9 protein was conjugated to CPP via a thioether bond, whereas the guide RNA was complexed with CPP, forming condensed, positively charged nanoparticles. Simultaneous and sequential treatment of human cells, including embryonic stem cells, dermal fibroblasts, HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells, with the modified Cas9 and guide RNA, leads to efficient gene disruptions with reduced off-target mutations relative to plasmid transfections, resulting in the generation of clones containing RGEN-induced mutations. Our CPP-mediated RGEN delivery process provides a plasmidfree and additional transfection reagent-free method to use this tool with reduced off-target effects. We envision that our method will facilitate RGEN-directed genome editing. © 2014 Ramakrishna et al.},

The expanding crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells. We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon. METHODS:Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized the mouse and human colon culture systems. RESULTS:Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition of nicotinamide, along with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk and an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells, and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus. CONCLUSIONS:We developed a technology that can be used to study infected, inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal tract. These tools might have applications in regenerative biology through ex vivo expansion of the intestinal epithelia. Studies of these cultures indicate that there is no inherent restriction in the replicative potential of adult stem cells (or a Hayflick limit) ex vivo.},

In vivo identification, quantification and characterization of senescent cells are challenging tasks that limit our understanding of the role of senescent cells in diseases and aging. Here, we present a new way to precisely quantify and identify senescent cells in tissues on a single-cell basis. The method combines a senescence-associated beta-galactosidase assay with staining of molecular markers for cellular senescence and of cellular identity. By utilizing technology that combines flow cytometry with high-content image analysis, we were able to quantify senescent cells in tumors, fibrotic tissues, and tissues of aged mice. Our approach also yielded the finding that senescent cells in tissues of aged mice are larger than nonsenescent cells. Thus, this method provides a basis for quantitative assessment of senescent cells and it offers proof of principle for combination of different markers of senescence. It paves the way for screening of senescent cells for identification of new senescence biomarkers, genes that bypass senescence or senolytic compounds that eliminate senescent cells, thus enabling a deeper understanding of the senescent state in vivo.},

Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene expression variability in single cells.},

	abstract = {A fundamental and unresolved problem in animal development is the question of how a growing tissue knows when it has achieved its correct final size. A widely held view suggests that this process is controlled by morphogen gradients, which adapt to tissue size and become flatter as tissue grows, leading eventually to growth arrest. Here, we present evidence that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen distribution in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disk does not adapt to disk size. We measure the distribution of a functional Dpp-GFP transgene and the Dpp signal transduced by phospho-Mad and show that the characteristic length scale of the Dpp profile remains approximately constant during growth. This finding suggests an alternative scenario of size determination, where disk size is determined relative to the fixed morphogen distribution by a certain threshold level of morphogen required for growth. We propose that when disk boundary reaches the threshold the arrest of cell proliferation throughout the disk is induced by mechanical stress in the tissue. Mechanical stress is expected to arise from the nonuniformity of morphogen distribution that drives growth. This stress, through a negative feedback on growth, can compensate for the nonuniformity of morphogen, achieving uniform growth with the rate that vanishes when disk boundary reaches the threshold. The mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulations of a tissue growth model that identifies the key assumptions and testable predictions. This analysis provides an alternative hypothesis for the size determination process. Novel experimental approaches will be needed to test this model.},

Analysis of the interaction patterns reveals a class of 'group-selective' inhibitors broadly active against a single subfamily of kinases, but selective outside that subfamily. The data set suggests compounds to use as tools to study kinases for which no dedicated inhibitors exist.

Large cells are produced by increasing DNA content or ploidy, a developmental strategy employed throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. The widespread use of polyploidy during cell differentiation makes it important to define how this hypertrophy contributes to organogenesis. I discuss here examples from a variety of animals and plants in which polyploidy controls organ size, the size and function of specific tissues within an organ, or the differentiated properties of cells. In addition, I highlight how polyploidy functions in wound healing and tissue regeneration.},

	abstract = {Although cell cycle control is an ancient, conserved, and essential process, some core animal and fungal cell cycle regulators share no more sequence identity than non-homologous proteins. Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the cis-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Normal human cells exhibit a limited replicative life span in culture, eventually arresting growth by a process termed senescence. Progressive telomere shortening appears to trigger senescence in normal human fibroblasts and retinal pigment epithelial cells, as ectopic expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit, hTERT, immortalizes these cell types directly. Telomerase expression alone is insufficient to enable certain other cell types to evade senescence, however. Such cells, including keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells, appear to require loss of the pRB/p16$^{\textrm{INK4a}}$ cell cycle control mechanism in addition to hTERT expression to achieve immortality. To investigate the relationships among telomerase activity, cell cycle control, senescence, and differentiation, we expressed hTERT in two epithelial cell types, keratinocytes and mesothelial cells, and determined the effect on proliferation potential and on the function of cell-type-specific growth control and differentiation systems. Ectopic hTERT expression immortalized normal mesothelial cells and a premalignant, p16$^{\textrm{INK4a}}$-negative keratinocyte line. In contrast, when four keratinocyte strains cultured from normal tissue were transduced to express hTERT, they were incompletely rescued from senescence. After reaching the population doubling limit of their parent cell strains, hTERT$^{\textrm{+}}$ keratinocytes entered a slow growth phase of indefinite length, from which rare, rapidly dividing immortal cells emerged. These immortal cell lines frequently had sustained deletions of the \textit{CDK2NA/INK4A} locus or otherwise were deficient in p16$^{\textrm{INK4a}}$ expression. They nevertheless typically retained other keratinocyte growth controls and differentiated normally in culture and in xenografts. Thus, keratinocyte replicative potential is limited by a p16$^{\textrm{INK4a}}$-dependent mechanism, the activation of which can occur independent of telomere length. Abrogation of this mechanism together with telomerase expression immortalizes keratinocytes without affecting other major growth control or differentiation systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This protocol explains step by step how to use MaxQuant on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) data obtained with double or triple labeling. Complex experimental designs, such as time series and drug-response data, are supported. A standard desktop computer is sufficient to fulfill the computational requirements. The workflow has been stress tested with more than 1,000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry runs in a single project. In a typical SILAC proteome experiment, hundreds of thousands of peptides and thousands of proteins are automatically and reliably quantified.

Here we estimate the in vivo translational speeds of all sense codons from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, preferentially used codons are not translated faster than unpreferred ones. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is a result of codon usage in proportion to cognate tRNA concentrations, the optimal strategy in enhancing translational efficiency under tRNA shortage. Our predicted codon-tRNA balance is indeed observed from all model eukaryotes examined, and its impact on translational efficiency is further validated experimentally. Our study reveals a previously unsuspected mechanism by which unequal codon usage increases translational efficiency, demonstrates widespread natural selection for translational efficiency, and offers new strategies to improve synthetic biology.},

To infer transcription kinetics for a gene-of-interest, researchers commonly compare the distribution of mRNA copy-number to the prediction of a theoretical model. However, the reliability of this procedure is limited because the measured mRNA numbers represent integration over the mRNA lifetime, contribution from multiple gene copies, and mixing of cells from different cell-cycle phases. We address these limitations by simultaneously quantifying nascent and mature mRNA in individual cells, and incorporating cell-cycle effects in the analysis of mRNA statistics. We demonstrate our approach on Oct4 and Nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells. Both genes follow similar two-state kinetics. However, Nanog exhibits slower ON/OFF switching, resulting in increased cell-to-cell variability in mRNA levels. Early in the cell cycle, the two copies of each gene exhibit independent activity. After gene replication, the probability of each gene copy to be active diminishes, resulting in dosage compensation.},

The mitotic spindle presents a central example of this flexibility, scaling with the dimensions of the cell to mediate accurate chromosome segregation. To determine whether spindle size regulation is achieved through a developmental program or is intrinsically specified by cell size or shape, we developed a system to encapsulate cytoplasm from Xenopus eggs and embryos inside cell-like compartments of defined sizes. Spindle size was observed to shrink with decreasing compartment size, similar to what occurs during early embryogenesis, and this scaling trend depended on compartment volume rather than shape. Thus, the amount of cytoplasmic material provides a mechanism for regulating the size of intracellular structures.},

	abstract = {Once adherens junctions (AJs) are formed between polarized epithelial cells they must be maintained because AJs are constantly remodeled in dynamic epithelia. AJ maintenance involves endocytosis and subsequent recycling of E-cadherin to a precise location along the basolateral membrane. In the Drosophila pupal eye epithelium, Rho1 GTPase regulates AJ remodeling through Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) endocytosis by limiting Cdc42/Par6/aPKC complex activity. We demonstrate that Rho1 also influences AJ remodeling by regulating the formation of DE-cadherin-containing, Rab11-positive recycling endosomes in Drosophila postmitotic pupal eye epithelia. This effect of Rho1 is mediated through Rok-dependent, but not MLCK-dependent, stimulation of myosin II activity yet independent of its effects upon actin remodeling. Both Rho1 and pMLC localize on endosomal vesicles, suggesting that Rho1 might regulate the formation of recycling endosomes through localized myosin II activation. This work identifies spatially distinct functions for Rho1 in the regulation of DE-cadherin-containing vesicular trafficking during AJ remodeling in live epithelia.},

A number of methods exist to measure different aspects of cell size, but each has significant drawbacks. Here, we present an alternative method to measure the size of single human cells using a nuclear localized fluorescent protein expressed from a constitutive promoter. We validate this method by comparing it to several established cell size measurement strategies, including flow cytometry optical scatter, total protein dyes, and quantitative phase microscopy. We directly compare our fluorescent protein measurement with the commonly used measurement of nuclear volume and show that our measurements are more robust and less dependent on image segmentation. We apply our method to examine how cell size impacts the cell division cycle and reaffirm that there is a negative correlation between size at cell birth and G1 duration. Importantly, combining our size reporter with fluorescent labeling of a different protein in a different color channel allows measurement of concentration dynamics using simple wide-field fluorescence imaging. Thus, we expect our method will be of use to researchers interested in how dynamically changing protein concentrations control cell fates.},

We generated embryonic stem (ES) cells and other cell types mutant for all three genes. Triple knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (TKO MEFs) had a shorter cell cycle than wild-type, single, or double knock-out control cells. TKO cells were resistant to G1 arrest following DNA damage, despite retaining functional p53 activity. They were also insensitive to G1 arrest signals following contact inhibition or serum starvation. Finally, TKO MEFs did not undergo senescence in culture and do possess some characteristics of transformed cells. Our results confirm the essential role of the Rb family in the control of the G1/S transition, place the three Rb family members downstream of multiple cell cycle control pathways, and further the link between loss of cell cycle control and tumorigenesis.},

We explored mechanisms of adherens junction (AJ):cytoskeleton linkage and roles of the linkage regulator Canoe/afadin during Drosophila germband extension (GBE), a convergent-extension process elongating the body axis. We found surprising parallels between GBE and a quite different morphogenetic movement, mesoderm apical constriction. Germband cells have an apical actomyosin network undergoing cyclical contractions. These coincide with a novel cell shape change–cell extension along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. In Canoe's absence, GBE is disrupted. The apical actomyosin network detaches from AJs at AP cell borders, reducing coordination of actomyosin contractility and cell shape change. Normal GBE requires planar polarization of AJs and the cytoskeleton. Canoe loss subtly enhances AJ planar polarity and dramatically increases planar polarity of the apical polarity proteins Bazooka/Par3 and atypical protein kinase C. Changes in Bazooka localization parallel retraction of the actomyosin network. Globally reducing AJ function does not mimic Canoe loss, but many effects are replicated by global actin disruption. Strong dose-sensitive genetic interactions between canoe and bazooka are consistent with them affecting a common process. We propose a model in which an actomyosin network linked at AP AJs by Canoe and coupled to apical polarity proteins regulates convergent extension.},

Here we show efficient gene KI in rats by combining CRISPR-Cas with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs). First, a 1-kb ssODN co-injected with guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 messenger RNA produce GFP-KI at the rat Thy1 locus. Then, two gRNAs with two 80-bp ssODNs direct efficient integration of a 5.5-kb CAG-GFP vector into the Rosa26 locus via ssODN-mediated end joining. This protocol also achieves KI of a 200-kb BAC containing the human SIRPA locus, concomitantly knocking out the rat Sirpa gene. Finally, three gRNAs and two ssODNs replace 58-kb of the rat Cyp2d cluster with a 6.2-kb human CYP2D6 gene. These ssODN-mediated KI protocols can be applied to any target site with any donor vector without the need to construct homology arms, thus simplifying genome engineering in living organisms. CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome engineering tool but gene knock-in is limited by fragment size and efficiency of recombination. Here the authors used a modified strategy employing single-strand oligonucleotides to efficiently knock-in large DNA fragments and humanise native rat loci.},

	abstract = {pRb, p107, and p130 are related proteins that play a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, it is still largely unclear how these proteins achieve this regulation in vivo. The intestinal epithelium is an ideal in vivo system in which to study the molecular pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation because it exists in a constant state of development throughout an animal's lifetime. We studied the phenotypic effects on the intestinal epithelium of mutating Rb and p107 or p130. Although mutating these genes singly had little or no effect, loss of pRb and p107 or p130 together produced chronic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the small intestinal and colonic epithelium. In Rb/p130 double mutants this hyperplasia was associated with defects in terminal differentiation of specific cell types and was dependent on the increased proliferation seen in the epithelium of mutant animals. At the molecular level, dysregulation of the Rb pathway led to an increase in the expression of Math1, Cdx1, Cdx2, transcription factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. The absence of Cdx1 function in Rb/p130 double mutant mice partially reverted the histologic phenotype by suppressing ectopic mitosis in the epithelium. These studies implicate the Rb pathway as a regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the intestine.},

We investigated several different light scattering and fluorescence measurements in several different cell lines, sorting cell fractions from the high and low end of distributions, and measuring volume electronically to determine which sorting strategy yielded the best separated volume distributions. Since we found that different optical measurements were optimal for different cell lines, we suggest that following this procedure will enable other investigators to optimize their own cell sorters for volume-based separation of the cell types with which they work.},

Our studies identify the dual-specific kinase MKK4 as a master regulator of liver regeneration. MKK4 silencing robustly increased the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes in mouse models of liver regeneration and acute and chronic liver failure. Mechanistically, induction of MKK7 and a JNK1-dependent activation of the AP1 transcription factor ATF2 and the Ets factor ELK1 are crucial for increased regeneration of hepatocytes with MKK4 silencing.},

Phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) promotes the assembly of myosin monomers into active contractile filaments and is an essential mechanism regulating the level of myosin activity. However, the effects of phosphorylation on myosin localization, dynamics, and function during epithelial remodeling are not well understood. In Drosophila, planar polarized myosin contractility is required for oriented cell rearrangements during elongation of the body axis. We show that regulated myosin phosphorylation influences spatial and temporal properties of contractile behavior at molecular, cellular, and tissue length scales. Expression of myosin RLC variants that prevent or mimic phosphorylation both disrupt axis elongation, but have distinct effects at the molecular and cellular levels. Unphosphorylatable RLC produces fewer, slower cell rearrangements, whereas phosphomimetic RLC accelerates rearrangement and promotes higher-order cell interactions. Quantitative live imaging and biophysical approaches reveal that both phosphovariants reduce myosin planar polarity and mechanical anisotropy, altering the orientation of cell rearrangements during axis elongation. Moreover, the localized myosin activator Rho-kinase is required for spatially regulated myosin activity, even when the requirement for phosphorylation is bypassed by the expression of phosphomimetic myosin RLC. These results indicate that myosin phosphorylation influences both the level and the spatiotemporal regulation of myosin activity, linking molecular properties of myosin activity to tissue morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Mechanical strain regulates the development, organization, and function of multicellular tissues, but mechanisms linking mechanical strain and cell-cell junction proteins to cellular responses are poorly understood. Here, we showed that mechanical strain applied to quiescent epithelial cells induced rapid cell cycle reentry, mediated by independent nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of first Yap1 and then β-catenin. Inhibition of Yap1- and β-catenin-mediated transcription blocked cell cycle reentry and progression through G1 into S phase, respectively. Maintenance of quiescence, Yap1 nuclear exclusion, and β-catenin transcriptional responses to mechanical strain required E-cadherin extracellular engagement. Thus, activation of Yap1 and β-catenin may represent a master regulator of mechanical strain-induced cell proliferation, and cadherins provide signaling centers required for cellular responses to externally applied force.},

	abstract = {Present studies were performed to investigate what factors affect the morphogenesis ot preimplantation mouse embryos, and to find the action mechanism of that factor by using cytoplasm removal and its reconstitution from a different developmental stage embryo. Half (HP group) or one-third of cytoplasm (TP group) was removed from 1-cell mouse embryos by micromanipulation, and their morphogenesis and genome expression were compared with sham-operated embryos (SP group). The compaction and blastocoel formation of embryos in both the HP and TP groups were accelerated in time and cell stage when compared with those of the SP group. However, the total activity and time of RNA synthesis, and gene expression of ZO-1α+ isoform were not different. To change the cytoplasm composition without altering the nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio, half a 1-cell embryo with both pronuclei was reconstituted with the half enucleated cytoplasm of 1-cell embryo (P + P group), 2-cell (P + 2 group) or 4-cell (P + 4 group) by electrofusion. Embryonic compaction, timing of RNA synthesis, and stage-specific gene expression of the ZO-1aα+ isoform in the P + 2 and P + 4 groups were accelerated in time and cell stage than that in the P + P group, but not different between the P + 2 and P + 4 groups. In addition, a blastomere of 2-cell embryo was reconstituted with the enucleated cytoplasm of 1-cell embryo (2 + P group) or 2-cell (2 + 2 group) in equal volume by electrofusion. Also, the karyoplast of 2-cell was fused with the enucleated 1-cell embryo (2 + PP group). Embryonic development, total activity of RNA synthesis, and gene expression of the ZO-1α+ isoform of embryos in the 2 + P and 2 + PP groups were delayed when compared with those of the 2 + 2 group. Also, the phenomena of compaction and blastocoel formation were delayed in the development time and cell stage. From these results, the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was found to have no direct effect on the regulation of embryonic morphogenesis, although it accelerated compaction and blastocoel formation. However, cytoplasmic factors that altered between 1- and 2-cell stages regulate embryonic morphogenesis, especially compaction, of preimplantation mouse embryos in concentration-dependent manner. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Fucci technology makes possible the distinction between live cells in the G1 and S/G2/M phases by dual-color imaging. This technology relies upon ubiquitylation-mediated proteolysis, and transgenic mice expressing Fucci provide a powerful model system with which to study the coordination of the cell cycle and development. The mice were initially generated using the CAG promoter; lines expressing the G1 and S/G2/M phase probes that emitted orange (mKO2) and green (mAG) fluorescence, respectively, were separately constructed. Owing to cell type-biased strength of the CAG promoter as well as the positional effects of random transgenesis, however, we noticed some variability in Fucci expression levels. To control more reliably the expression of cell cycle probes, we used different genetic approaches to create two types of reporter mouse lines with Fucci2 and Rosa26 transcriptional machinery. Fucci2 is a recently developed Fucci derivative, which emits red (mCherry) and green (mVenus) fluorescence and provides better color contrast than Fucci. A new transgenic line, R26p-Fucci2, utilizes the Rosa26 promoter and harbors the G1 and S/G2/M phase probes in a single transgene to preserve their co-inheritance. In the other R26R-Fucci2 approach, the two probes are incorporated into Rosa26 locus conditionally. The Cre-mediated loxP recombination technique thus allows researchers to design cell-type-specific Fucci2 expression. By performing time-lapse imaging experiments using R26p-Fucci2 and R26-Fucci2 in which R26R-Fucci2 had undergone germline loxP recombination, we demonstrated the great promise of these mouse reporters for studying cell cycle behavior in vivo. © 2013.

The dominant model for eukaryotic cell cycle control proposes that cell cycle progression is driven by a succession of CDK complexes with different substrate specificities. However, in fission yeast it has been shown that a single CDK complex generated by the fusion of the Cdc13 cyclin with the CDK protein Cdc2 can drive the mitotic cell cycle. Meiosis is a modified cell cycle programme in which a single S-phase is followed by two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. Here we systematically analyse the requirements of the different fission yeast cyclins for meiotic cell cycle progression. We also show that a single Cdc13-Cdc2 complex, in the absence of the other cyclins, can drive the meiotic cell cycle. We propose that qualitatively different CDK complexes are not absolutely required for cell cycle progression either during mitosis or meiosis, and that a single CDK complex can drive both cell cycle programmes.},

Here, we examine the importance of the tissue environment for chromosome segregation by comparing chromosome segregation fidelity across several primary cell types in native and nonnative contexts. We discover that epithelial cells have increased chromosome missegregation outside of their native tissues. Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for accurate chromosome segregation. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and this is especially important for maintaining chromosome stability in the polyploid liver. We propose that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie the widespread chromosome instability across epithelial cancers. Moreover, our findings highlight the extent to which extracellular context can influence intrinsic cellular processes and the limitations of cell culture systems for studying cells that naturally function within a tissue.},

RESULTS:Here, we utilized the Cre/loxP system to investigate the function of the retinoblastoma protein, pRb in intestinal epithelium. pRb null mice displayed a profoundly altered development of the intestine with increased proliferation and abnormal expression of differentiation markers. Loss of pRb induces cell hyperproliferation in the proliferative region (crypt) as well as in the differentiated zone (villi). The absence of pRb further results in an increase in the population of enterocytes, goblet, enteroendocrine and Paneth cells. In addition, differentiated enteroendocrine cells failed to exit the cell cycle in the absence of pRb. These proliferative changes were accompanied by increased expression of Indian hedgehog and activation of hedgehog signals, a known pathway for intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. CONCLUSION:Our studies have revealed a unique function of pRb in intestine development which is critical for controlling not only the proliferation of a stem cell or progenitor cell population but that of terminally differentiated cells as well.},

However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS signals, given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. For a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detected the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with greater precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications was obtained via a t test approach. For a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitude, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to many biological questions; it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in a manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button.},

One hypothesis is that frequent codons are translated relatively rapidly. However, there is little direct, in vivo, evidence regarding codon-specific translation rates. In this study, we generate high-coverage data using ribosome profiling in yeast, analyze using a novel algorithm, and deduce events at the A- and P-sites of the ribosome. Different codons are decoded at different rates in the A-site. In general, frequent codons are decoded more quickly than rare codons, and AT-rich codons are decoded more quickly than GC-rich codons. At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds. We also apply our algorithm to short footprints from a different conformation of the ribosome and find strong amino acid-specific (not codon-specific) effects that may reflect interactions with the exit tunnel of the ribosome.},

	abstract = {The expression profiles and spatial distributions of RNAs regulate many cellular functions. Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80\% detection efficiency and ∼4\% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues.},

However, the translational landscape of gene expression underlying cell-cycle progression remains largely unknown. Employing genome-wide ribosome profiling, we uncover widespread translational regulation of hundreds of mRNAs serving as an unexpected mechanism for gene regulation underlying cell-cycle progression. A striking example is the S phase translational regulation of RICTOR, which is associated with cell cycle-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling and accurate cell-cycle progression. We further identified unappreciated coordination in translational control of mRNAs within molecular complexes dedicated to cell-cycle progression, lipid metabolism, and genome integrity. This includes the majority of mRNAs comprising the cohesin and condensin complexes responsible for maintaining genome organization, which are coordinately translated during specific cell cycle phases via their 5' UTRs. Our findings illuminate the prevalence and dynamic nature of translational regulation underlying the mammalian cell cycle.},

	abstract = {In cells, many vital processes involve myosin-driven motility that actively remodels the actin cytoskeleton and changes cell shape. Here we study how the collective action of myosin motors organizes actin filaments into contractile structures in a simplified model system devoid of biochemical regulation. We show that this self-organization occurs through an active multistage coarsening process. First, motors form dense foci by moving along the actin network structure followed by coalescence. Then the foci accumulate actin filaments in a shell around them. These actomyosin condensates eventually cluster due to motor-driven coalescence. We propose that the physical origin of this multistage aggregation is the highly asymmetric load response of actin filaments: they can support large tensions but buckle easily under piconewton compressive loads. Because the motor-generated forces well exceed this threshold, buckling is induced on the connected actin network that resists motor-driven filament sliding. We show how this buckling can give rise to the accumulation of actin shells around myosin foci and subsequent coalescence of foci into superaggregates. This new physical mechanism provides an explanation for the formation and contractile dynamics of disordered condensed actomyosin states observed in vivo.},

For the generated genotypes, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) also were obtained. While inactivation of Rb alone did not alleviate the senescence response of MEFs, pRB/p107-deficient MEFs, after having adapted to in vitro culturing, continued to proliferate at modest rate. Additional ablation of p130 rendered MEFs completely insensitive to senescence-inducing signals and strongly increased their proliferation rate.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The speed of translation elongation is primarily determined by the abundance of tRNAs. Thus, the codon usage influences the rate with which individual mRNAs are translated. As the nature of tRNA pools and modifications can vary across biological conditions, codon elongation rates may also vary, leading to fluctuations in the protein production from individual mRNAs. Although it has been observed that functionally related mRNAs exhibit similar codon usage, presumably to provide an effective way to coordinate expression of multiple proteins, experimental evidence for codon-mediated translation efficiency modulation of functionally related mRNAs in specific conditions is scarce and the associated mechanisms are still debated. RESULTS:Here, we reveal that mRNAs whose expression increases during cell proliferation are enriched in rare codons, poorly adapted to tRNA pools. Ribosome occupancy profiling and proteomics measurements show that upon increased cell proliferation, transcripts enriched in rare codons undergo a higher translation boost than transcripts with common codons. Re-coding of a fluorescent reporter with rare codons increased protein output by {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 30\% relative to a reporter re-coded with common codons. Although the translation capacity of proliferating cells was higher compared to resting cells, we did not find evidence for the regulation of individual tRNAs. Among the models that were proposed so far to account for codon-mediated translational regulation upon changing conditions, the one that seems most consistent with our data involves a global upregulation of ready-to-translate tRNAs, which we show can lead to a higher increase in the elongation velocity at rare codons compared to common codons. CONCLUSIONS:We propose that the alleviation of translation bottlenecks in rapidly dividing cells enables preferential upregulation of pro-proliferation proteins, encoded by mRNAs that are enriched in rare codons.},

In this study, we provide evidence that these cells sense their surface area as part of this size control mechanism. We show that cells enter mitosis at a certain surface area, as opposed to a certain volume or length. A peripheral membrane protein kinase cdr2p has properties of a dose-dependent 'sizer' that controls mitotic entry. As cells grow, the local cdr2p concentration in nodes at the medial cortex accumulates as a measure of cell surface area. Our findings, which challenge a previously proposed pom1p gradient model, lead to a new model in which cells sense their size by using cdr2p to probe the surface area over the whole cell and relay this information to the medial cortex.

These include simple repeats, satellites, LINEs, and endogenous retroviruses as well as transposon fragments. We generated a mutant mouse strain carrying an F832A mutation in Rb1 that is defective for recruitment to repetitive sequences. Loss of pRB-EZH2 complexes from repeats disperses H3K27me3 from these genomic locations and permits repeat expression. Consistent with maintenance of H3K27me3 at the Hox clusters, these mice are developmentally normal.

	doi = {10.1038/nature21407},
	abstract = {Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.},

	abstract = {© Ly et al. The temporal regulation of protein abundance and post-translational modifications is a key feature of cell division. Recently, we analysed gene expression and protein abundance changes during interphase under minimally perturbed conditions (Ly et al., 2014, 2015). Here, we show that by using specific intracellular immunolabelling protocols, FACS separation of interphase and mitotic cells, including mitotic subphases, can be combined with proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry. Using this PRIMMUS (PRoteomic analysis of Intracellular iMMUnolabelled cell Subsets) approach, we now compare protein abundance and phosphorylation changes in interphase and mitotic fractions from asynchronously growing human cells. We identify a set of 115 phosphorylation sites increased during G2, termed ‘early risers’. This set includes phosphorylation of S738 on TPX2, which we show is important for TPX2 function and mitotic progression. Further, we use PRIMMUS to provide the first a proteome-wide analysis of protein abundance remodeling between prophase, prometaphase and anaphase.},

	abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.},

Such transitions, including cell fate decisions, often employ positive feedback regulation to establish and stabilize new cellular states. However, positive feedback is unlikely to underlie stable cell-cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone because the signaling pathway is linear, rather than bistable, over a broad range of extracellular pheromone concentration. We show that the stability of the pheromone-arrested state results from coherent feedforward regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor Far1. This network motif is effectively isolated from the more complex regulatory network in which it is embedded. Fast regulation of Far1 by phosphorylation allows rapid cell-cycle arrest and reentry, whereas slow Far1 synthesis reinforces arrest. We expect coherent feedforward regulation to be frequently implemented at reversible cellular transitions because this network motif can achieve the ostensibly conflicting aims of arrest stability and rapid reversibility without loss of signaling information.},

Different cells produce different protrusions, from keratocytes dominated by lamellipodia, to growth cones combining filopodia and lamellipodia, to dendritic spines. One key challenge is to determine how the toolkit of actin regulators are coordinated to generate these diverse protrusive arrays. Here we use Drosophila leading-edge (LE) cells to explore how Diaphanous (Dia)-related formins and Ena/VASP proteins cooperate in this process. We first dissect the Dia regulatory region, revealing novel roles for the GTPase-binding and FH3 domains in cortical localization, filopodial initiation, and lengthening. Second, we provide evidence that activating Dia mobilizes Ena from storage places near the LE to act at the LE. Further, Dia and Ena coIP and can recruit one another to new locations, suggesting cooperation is key to their mechanisms of action. Third, we directly explore the functional relationship between Dia and Ena, varying their levels and activity separately in the same cell type. Surprisingly, although each is sufficient to induce filopodia, together they induce lamellipodia. Our data suggest they work together in a complex and nonadditive way, with the ratio between active Dia and Ena being one factor that modulates the balance between filopodia and lamellipodia.},

We quantify the variation of wing imaginal disc proteomes in Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP) lines using SWATH mass spectrometry. In spite of the very large genetic variation (1/36 bp) between the lines, proteome variability is surprisingly small, indicating strong molecular resilience of protein expression patterns. Proteins associated with adult wing size form tight co-variation clusters that are enriched in fundamental biochemical processes. Wing size correlates with some basic metabolic functions, positively with glucose metabolism but negatively with mitochondrial respiration and not with ribosome biogenesis. Our study highlights the power of PWAS to filter functional variants from the large genetic variability in natural populations. How genetic diversity generates complex phenotypes along a continuum remains a fundamental question of biology.

An HIV vector containing a gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was injected into the sub-retinal space of rat eyes. The GFP gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was efficiently expressed in both photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelium. However, the use of the rhodopsin promoter resulted in expression predominantly in photoreceptor cells. Most successfully transduced eyes showed that photoreceptor cells in {\textgreater}80\% of the area of whole retina expressed the GFP. The GFP expression persisted for at least 12 weeks with no apparent decrease.

The demonstration of force activation, identification of consequent downstream events in live cells, and development of tools to study these dynamic processes in living cells are central to elucidating the role of α-catenin in cellular mechanics and tissue function [2-10]. Here we demonstrate that α-catenin is a force-activatable mechanotransducer at cell-cell junctions by using an engineered α-catenin conformation sensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). This sensor reconstitutes α-catenin-dependent functions in α-catenin-depleted cells and recapitulates the behavior of the endogenous protein. Dynamic imaging of cells expressing the sensor demonstrated that α-catenin undergoes immediate, reversible conformation switching in direct response to different mechanical perturbations of cadherin adhesions. Combined magnetic twisting cytometry with dynamic FRET imaging [11] revealed rapid, local conformation switching upon the mechanical stimulation of specific cadherin bonds. At acutely stretched cell-cell junctions, the immediate, reversible conformation change further reveals that α-catenin behaves like an elastic spring in series with cadherin and actin. The force-dependent recruitment of vinculin - a principal α-catenin effector - to junctions requires the vinculin binding site of the α-catenin sensor [1, 12-16]. In cells, the relative rates of force-dependent α-catenin conformation switching and vinculin recruitment reveal that α-catenin activation and vinculin recruitment occur sequentially, rather than in a concerted process, with vinculin accumulation being significantly slower. This engineered α-catenin sensor revealed that α-catenin is a reversible, stretch-activatable sensor that mechanically links cadherin complexes and actin and is an indispensable player in cadherin-specific mechanotransduction at intercellular junctions.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between cell size and cell division in two situations. In the first, quiescent cells were sorted on the basis of cell size using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and returned to culture. The results of this type of experiment are compatible with the idea that once cells have completed a size-dependent lag, the rate of entry of cells into S phase is controlled by a rate-limiting random event (or transition). The second kind of experiment follows the kinetics of complete cell cycles in rapidly proliferating cells whose mothers had been sorted on the basis of cell size. The cells born of small mother cells have longer cycle times than cells derived from large mothers. The difference in the cycle time of these two classes was due to differences in the B phase of the cell cycle [containing S, G2, M and part of G1 (G1B)], transition probability being the same in both size classes. Our results show that S, G2 and M are unaffected by size, thus confining the effect of size to G1B. It seems probable that the variability of B phase in cloned cell populations is partly due to variations of cell size at division, and correlations between the cycle times of sister cells result because sibling cells are more similar in size than unrelated cells. The major factor controlling cell division in mouse fibroblasts is shown, however, to be the transition probability; size has a more minor role. © 1978.},

Indeed, the recent integration of quantitative experimental data, force measurements and mathematical modeling has changed our understanding of morphogenesis – the shaping of an organism during development. Emerging evidence suggests that the subcellular organization of contractile cytoskeletal networks plays a key role in force generation, while on the tissue level the spatial organization of forces determines the morphogenetic output. Inspired by D9Arcy Thompson9s \textit{On Growth and Form}, we review our current understanding of how biological forms are created and maintained by the generation and organization of contractile forces at the cell and tissue levels. We focus on recent advances in our understanding of how cells actively sculpt tissues and how forces are involved in specific morphogenetic processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. Cell migration is important in many biological processes, including embryonic development, cancer metastasis and wound healing. In these tissues, a cell's motion is often strongly constrained by its neighbours, leading to glassy dynamics. Although self-propelled particle models exhibit a density-driven glass transition, this does not explain liquid-to-solid transitions in confluent tissues, where there are no gaps between cells and therefore the density is constant. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new type of rigidity transition that occurs in the well-studied vertex model for confluent tissue monolayers at constant density. We find that the onset of rigidity is governed by a model parameter that encodes single-cell properties such as cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension, providing an explanation for liquid-to-solid transitions in confluent tissues and making testable predictions about how these transitions differ from those in particulate matter.},

	abstract = {Regulation of the cell cycle is intimately linked to erythroid differentiation, yet how these processes are coupled is not well understood. To gain insight into this coordinate regulation, we examined the role that the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a central regulator of the cell cycle, plays in erythropoiesis. We found that Rb serves a cell-intrinsic role and its absence causes ineffective erythropoiesis, with a differentiation block at the transition from early to late erythroblasts. Unexpectedly, in addition to a failure to properly exit the cell cycle, mitochondrial biogenesis fails to be up-regulated concomitantly, contributing to this differentiation block. The link between erythropoiesis and mitochondrial function was validated by inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis. Erythropoiesis in the absence of Rb resembles the human myelodysplastic syndromes, where defects in cell cycle regulation and mitochondrial function frequently occur. Our work demonstrates how these seemingly disparate pathways play a role in coordinately regulating cellular differentiation. © 2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Unicellular organisms tend to proliferate whenever environmental Conditions—nutrients, oxygen, temperature, etc.—permit, and they cease growth when one or another of these conditions throttles their metabolism. In such cells, the progress of the division cycle is generally tightly coupled to cell growth. In contrast, animal cells exist in physiologically controlled environments that are nearly always nutrient-rich, yet they proliferate selectively. Specific autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine signals stimulate or limit cell growth and proliferation according to rules that benefit the organism as a whole. Moreover, the division cycle in multicellular systems is not always growth-coupled. Some cell types, like neurons and oocytes, grow without dividing, whereas others, such as spermatocytes, early blastomeres, and neuroblasts, can divide many times with little or no growth. Thus, the controls for cell growth and cell-cycle progression, although overlapping, are not the same in animal cells. In this chapter, we discuss the various modes of cell cycling and cell growth that occur during Drosophila development, and we examine the relationship between these two processes. OUTLINE OF CELL GROWTH AND PROLIFERATION DURING DROSOPHILA DEVELOPMENT Growth-independent Cell Cycles in Embryogenesis Careful descriptive studies of Drosophila from as long ago as the 1920s provide a rich literature on cell-cycle dynamics during development (Lee and Orr-Weaver 2003). The first cell cycles of embryogenesis are the female meiotic divisions, which are triggered by ovulation (Huettner 1924). Following meiosis and fertilization, the embryonic nuclei undergo 13 rapid mitotic divisions, which are driven by maternal proteins and mRNAs (Rabinowitz 1941; Foe and...},

	abstract = {E2F is a heterogenous transcription factor and its role in cell cycle control results from the integrated activities of many different E2F family members. Unlike mammalian cells, that have a large number of E2F-related genes, the Drosophila genome encodes just two E2F genes, de2f1 and de2f2. Here we show that de2f1 and de2f2 provide different elements of E2F regulation and that they have opposing functions during Drosophila development. dE2F1 and dE2F2 both heterodimerize with dDP and bind to the promoters of E2F-regulated genes in vivo. dE2F1 is a potent activator of transcription, and the loss of de2f1 results in the reduced expression of E2F-regulated genes. In contrast, dE2F2 represses the transcription of E2F reporters and the loss of de2f2 function results in increased and expanded patterns of gene expression. The loss of de2f1 function has previously been reported to compromise cell proliferation. de2f1 mutant embryos have reduced expression of E2F-regulated genes, low levels of DNA synthesis, and hatch to give slow-growing larvae. We find that these defects are due in large part to the unchecked activity of dE2F2, since they can be suppressed by mutation of de2f2. Examination of eye discs from de2f1; de2f2 double-mutant animals reveals that relatively normal patterns of DNA synthesis can occur in the absence of both E2F proteins. This study shows how repressor and activator E2Fs are used to pattern transcription and how the net effect of E2F on cell proliferation results from the interplay between two types of E2F complexes that have antagonistic functions.},

Single-cell time-lapse imaging and computational modeling of NF-kappaB (RelA) localization showed asynchronous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased IkappaBalpha transcription. Transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The functional consequences of NF-kappaB signaling may thus depend on number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.},

	abstract = {Cells escape the need for mitogens at a restriction point several hours before entering S phase. The restriction point has been proposed to result from CDK4/6 initiating partial Rb phosphorylation to trigger a bistable switch whereby cyclin E-CDK2 and Rb mutually reinforce each other to induce Rb hyperphosphorylation. Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over. Thus, it is short-term memory, or transient hysteresis, in CDK4/6 activity following mitogen removal that sustains Rb hyperphosphorylation, demonstrating a probabilistic rather than an irreversible molecular mechanism underlying the restriction point.},

Improved understanding of quiescent stem cell dynamics is leading to novel approaches to enhance maintenance and repair of aged or diseased tissues. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of stem cell quiescence and techniques enabling more refined analyses of quiescence in vivo.},

We found that most disseminated CRC cells in circulation were Lgr5- and formed distant metastases in which Lgr5+ CSCs appeared. This plasticity occurred independently of stemness-inducing microenvironmental factors and was indispensable for outgrowth, but not establishment, of metastases. Together, these findings show that most colorectal cancer metastases are seeded by Lgr5- cells, which display intrinsic capacity to become CSCs in a niche-independent manner and can restore epithelial hierarchies in metastatic tumors.},

Extending physical models to account for mechanical polarization helps solve a long-standing paradox about magnitudes of tissue surface tensions and potentially explains discrepancies between recent in vivo and in vitro cell-sorting experiments. New experiments are needed to further explore the connection between mechanical polarization and tissue boundary formation in vivo.},

	abstract = {Cells divide with appropriate frequency by coupling division to growth—that is, cells divide only when they have grown sufficiently large. This process is poorly understood, but has been studied using cell size mutants. In principle, mutations affecting cell size could affect the mean size (“set-point” mutants), or they could affect the variability of sizes (“homeostasis” mutants). In practice, almost all known size mutants affect set-point, with little effect on size homeostasis. One model for size-dependent division depends on a size-dependent gene expression program: Activators of cell division are over-expressed at larger and larger sizes, while inhibitors are under-expressed. At sufficiently large size, activators overcome inhibitors, and the cell divides. Amounts of activators and inhibitors determine the set-point, but the gene expression program (the rate at which expression changes with cell size) determines the breadth of the size distribution (homeostasis). In this model, set-point mutants identify cell cycle activators and inhibitors, while homeostasis mutants identify regulators that couple expression of activators and inhibitors to size. We consider recent results suggesting that increased cell size causes senescence, and suggest that at very large sizes, an excess of DNA binding proteins leads to size induced senescence.},

However, it is difficult to determine the function of single transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility.},

	abstract = {Cell dynamics in subcutaneous and breast tumors can be studied through conventional imaging windows with intravital microscopy. By contrast, visualization of the formation of metastasis has been hampered by the lack of long-term imaging windows for metastasis-prone organs, such as the liver. We developed an abdominal imaging window (AIW) to visualize distinct biological processes in the spleen, kidney, small intestine, pancreas, and liver. The AIW can be used to visualize processes for up to 1 month, as we demonstrate with islet cell transplantation. Furthermore, we have used the AIW to image the single steps of metastasis formation in the liver over the course of 14 days. We observed that single extravasated tumor cells proliferated to form "pre-micrometastases," in which cells lacked contact with neighboring tumor cells and were active and motile within the confined region of the growing clone. The clones then condensed into micrometastases where cell migration was strongly diminished but proliferation continued. Moreover, the metastatic load was reduced by suppressing tumor cell migration in the pre-micrometastases. We suggest that tumor cell migration within pre-micrometastases is a contributing step that can be targeted therapeutically during liver metastasis formation.},

The second method is based on the alkalinization of lysosomes, followed by the use of 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside (C12FDG), a fluorogenic substrate for betagal activity. The cytochemical method takes about 30 min to execute, and several hours to a day to develop and score. The fluorescence methods take between 4 and 8 h to execute and can be scored in a single day. The cytochemical method is applicable to tissue sections and requires simple reagents and equipment. The fluorescence-based methods have the advantages of being more quantitative and sensitive.},

	abstract = {The longer cells stay in particular phases of the cell cycle, the longer it will take these cell populations to increase. However, the above qualitative description has very little predictive value, unless it can be codified mathematically. A quantitative relation that defines the population doubling time (Td) as a function of the time eukaryotic cells spend in specific cell cycle phases would be instrumental for estimating rates of cell proliferation and for evaluating introduced perturbations. Here, we show that in human cells, the length of the G1 phase (TG1) regressed on Td with a slope of ≈0.75, while in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the slope was slightly smaller, at ≈0.60. On the other hand, cell size was not strongly associated with Td or TG1 in cell cultures that were proliferating at different rates. Furthermore, we show that levels of the yeast G1 cyclin [Cln3p][1] were positively associated with rates of cell proliferation over a broad range, at least in part through translational control mediated by a short upstream ORF (uORF) in the [CLN3][1] transcript. [Cln3p][1] was also necessary for the proper scaling between TG1 and Td. In contrast, yeast lacking the [Whi5p][2] transcriptional repressor maintained the scaling between TG1 and Td. These data reveal fundamental scaling relationships between the duration of eukaryotic cell cycle phases and rates of cell proliferation, point to the necessary role of [Cln3p][1] in these relationships in yeast, and provide a mechanistic basis linking [Cln3p][1] levels to proliferation rates and the scaling of G1 with doubling time.

The multicellular dynamics of such systems is influenced by mechanical conditions and can give rise to cell rearrangements and movements. We develop a continuum description of tissue dynamics, which describes the stress distribution and the cell flow field on large scales. In the absence of division and apoptosis, we consider the tissue to behave as an elastic solid. Cell division and apoptosis introduce stress sources that, in general, are anisotropic. By combining cell number balance with dynamic equations for the stress source, we show that the tissue effectively behaves as a viscoelastic fluid with a relaxation time set by the rates of division and apoptosis. If the system is confined in a fixed volume, it reaches a homeostatic state in which division and apoptosis balance. In this state, cells undergo a diffusive random motion driven by the stochasticity of division and apoptosis. We calculate the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the tissue parameters and compare our results concerning both diffusion and viscosity to simulations of multicellular systems using dissipative particle dynamics.},

How these interactions influence cellular gene expression remains unclear. We find that e1a displaces RBs from E2F transcription factors and promotes p300 acetylation of RB1 K873/K874 to lock it into a repressing conformation that interacts with repressive chromatin-modifying enzymes. These repressing p300-e1a-RB1 complexes specifically interact with host genes that have unusually high p300 association within the gene body. The TGFβ-, TNF-, and interleukin-signaling pathway components are enriched among such p300-targeted genes. The p300-e1a-RB1 complex condenses chromatin in a manner dependent on HDAC activity, p300 lysine acetylase activity, the p300 bromodomain, and RB K873/K874 and e1a K239 acetylation to repress host genes that would otherwise inhibit productive virus infection. Thus, adenovirus employs e1a to repress host genes that interfere with viral replication.},

	abstract = {Inactivation of the gene encoding the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein is recognized as the key early event in the development of colorectal cancers (CRC). Apc loss leads to nuclear localization of beta-catenin and constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex. This complex drives the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression such as c-Myc and cyclin D2. Acute loss of Apc in the small intestine leads to hyperproliferation within the intestinal crypt, increased levels of apoptosis, and perturbed differentiation and migration. It has been demonstrated that c-Myc is a critical mediator of the phenotypic abnormalities that follow Apc loss in the intestine. As it may be difficult to pharmacologically inhibit transcription factors such as c-Myc, investigating more druggable targets of the Wnt-c-Myc pathway within the intestine may reveal potential therapeutic targets for CRC. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that the cyclin D2-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) complex promotes hyperproliferation in Apc deficient intestinal tissue and ApcMin/+ adenomas. We showed that the hyperproliferative phenotype associated with Apc loss in vivo was partially dependent on the expression of cyclin D2. Most importantly, tumour growth and development in ApcMin/+ mice was strongly perturbed in mice lacking cyclin D2. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6 suppressed the proliferation of adenomatous cells. This commentary discusses the significance of this work in providing evidence for the importance of the cyclin D2-CDK4/6 complex in colorectal adenoma formation. It also argues that inhibition of this complex may be an effective chemopreventative strategy in CRC.},

	abstract = {Clustering provides a common means of identifying structure in complex data, and there is renewed interest in clustering as a tool for the analysis of large data sets in many fields. A natural question is how many clusters are appropriate for the description of a given system. Traditional approaches to this problem are based on either a framework in which clusters of a particular shape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which a clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of clusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification to determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics approach, clustering can be seen as a trade-off between energy- and entropy-like terms, with lower temperature driving the proliferation of clusters to provide a more detailed description of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that there is a limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and therefore a minimum temperature beyond which we will capture sampling noise. This suggests that correcting the clustering criterion for the bias that arises due to sampling errors will allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature that is optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful structure–without having to define an external criterion for the goodness or stability of the clustering. We show that in a general information-theoretic framework, the finite size of a data set determines an optimal temperature, and we introduce a method for finding the maximal number of clusters that can be resolved from the data in the hard clustering limit.},

Our data revealed that, twice during the cell cycle, growth rates are selectively increased in small cells and reduced in large cells, ensuring cell size uniformity. This regulation was also observed directly by monitoring nuclear growth in live cells. We also detected cell-size-dependent adjustments of G1 length, which further reduce variability. Combining our assays with chemical/genetic perturbations confirmed that cells employ two strategies, adjusting both cell cycle length and growth rate, to maintain the appropriate size. Additionally, although Rb signaling is not required for these regulatory behaviors, perturbing Cdk4 activity still influences cell size, suggesting that the Cdk4 pathway may play a role in designating the cell's target size.},

Recent studies suggest that RB is also involved in embryonic development of murine central nervous and hematopoietic systems. We have investigated RB expression and function in human adult hematopoiesis–i.e., in liquid suspension culture of purified quiescent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induced by growth factor stimulus to proliferation and unilinage differentiation/maturation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage. In the initial HPC differentiation stages, the RB gene is gradually induced at the mRNA and protein level in both erythroid and granulopoietic cultures. In late HPC differentiation and then precursor maturation, RB gene expression is sustained in the erythroid lineage, whereas it is sharply downmodulated in the granulocytic series. Functional studies were performed by treatment of HPC differentiation culture with phosphorothioate antisense oligomer targeting Rb mRNA; coherent with the expression pattern, oligomer treatment of late HPCs causes a dose-dependent and selective inhibition of erythroid colony formation. These observations suggest that the RB gene plays an erythroid- and stage-specific functional role in normal adult hematopoiesis, particularly at the level of late erythroid HPCs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {How size is controlled is a fundamental question in biology. In this review, we discuss the use of scaling relationships-for example, power-laws of the form y∝x(α)-to provide a framework for comparison and interpretation of size measurements. Such analysis can illustrate the biological and physical principles underlying observed trends, as has been proposed for the allometric dependence of metabolic rate or limb structure on organism mass. Techniques for measuring size at smaller length-scales continue to improve, leading to more data on the control of size in cells and organelles. Size scaling of these structures is expected to influence growth patterns, functional capacity and intracellular transport. Furthermore, organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum show widely varying morphologies that affect their scaling properties. We provide brief summaries of these issues for individual organelles, and conclude with a discussion on how to apply this concept to better understand the mechanisms of size control in the cellular environment.},

	abstract = {Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues relies on the precise developmental control of cell polarity and architecture. In the early Drosophila embryo, the primary epithelium forms during cellularisation, following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are upregulated. Some of them, for example, control membrane invagination between the nuclei anchored at the apical surface of the syncytium. We used microarrays to describe the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of upregulated genes during this process. Fifty-seven genes were then tested functionally by RNAi. We found six genes affecting various aspects of cellular architecture: membrane growth, organelle transport or organisation and junction assembly. We focus here on charleston (char), a new regulator of nuclear morphogenesis and of apical nuclear anchoring. In char-depleted embryos, the nuclei fail to maintain their elongated shape and, instead, become rounded. In addition, together with a disruption of the centrosome-nuclear envelope interaction, the nuclei lose their regular apical anchoring. These nuclear defects perturb the regular columnar organisation of epithelial cells in the embryo. Although microtubules are required for both nuclear morphogenesis and anchoring, char does not control microtubule organisation and association to the nuclear envelope. We show that Char is lipid anchored at the nuclear envelope by a farnesylation group, and localises at the inner nuclear membrane together with Lamin. Our data suggest that Char forms a scaffold that regulates nuclear architecture to constrain nuclei in tight columnar epithelial cells. The upregulation of Char during cellularisation and gastrulation reveals the existence of an as yet unknown developmental control of nuclear morphology and anchoring in embryonic epithelia.},

Cells are shed from the tissue surface and replaced by cell division. Yet, the cellular mechanisms that underpin these tissues homeostasis remain poorly established, having important implications for wound healing and carcinogenesis. Lineage tracing, in which of a cohort of proliferating cells and their descendants are genetically labelled in transgenic mice, has been used to study the fate behavior of the proliferating cells that maintain these tissues. However, based on this technique, distinct mutually irreconcilable models, differing in the implored number and hierarchy of proliferating cell types, have been proposed to explain homeostasis. To elucidate which of these conflicting scenarios should prevail, here we performed cell proliferation assays across multiple body sites in transgenic H2BGFP mouse epidermis and esophagus. Cell-cycle properties were then extracted from the H2BGFP dilution kinetics and adopted in a common analytic approach for a refined analysis of a new lineage-tracing experiment and eight published clonal data sets from esophagus and different skin territories. Our results show H2BGFP dilution profiles remained unimodal over time, indicating the absence of slow-cycling stem cells across all tissues analyzed. We find that despite using diverse genetic labelling approaches, all lineage-tracing data sets are consistent with tissues maintenance by a single population of proliferating cells. The outcome of a given division is unpredictable but, on average the likelihood of producing proliferating and differentiating cells is balanced, ensuring tissue homeostasis. The fate outcomes of sister cells are anticorrelated. We conclude a single cell population maintains squamous epithelial homeostasis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A well-known target of cyclin D-Cdk4,6 is the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which inhibits cell-cycle progression until its inactivation by phosphorylation. However, the role of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 in cell-cycle progression is unclear because Rb can be phosphorylated by other cyclin-Cdks, and cyclin D-Cdk4,6 has other targets involved in cell division. Here, we show that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 docks one side of an alpha-helix in the Rb C terminus, which is not recognized by cyclins E, A, and B. This helix-based docking mechanism is shared by the p107 and p130 Rb-family members across metazoans. Mutation of the Rb C-terminal helix prevents its phosphorylation, promotes G1 arrest, and enhances Rb's tumor suppressive function. Our work conclusively demonstrates that the cyclin D-Rb interaction drives cell division and expands the diversity of known cyclin-based protein docking mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Control of cell proliferation is a fundamental aspect of tissue physiology central to morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer. Although many of the molecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth is still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation is encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures and is known as "contact inhibition." The study presented here provides a quantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and single cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells we demonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows inhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local expansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and cell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change across the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing cell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising through reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of cell size, and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area falls below a critical value.

Our measurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of mechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone, and define quantitative phenotypes that can guide future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying contact inhibition.},

	abstract = {Organisms containing an increase in DNA content by whole number multiples of the entire set of chromosomes are defined as polyploid. Cells that contain more than two sets of chromosomes were first observed in plants about a century ago, and it is now recognized that polyploid cells form in many eukaryotes under a wide variety of circumstances. Although it is less common in mammals, some tissues, including the liver, show a high percentage of polyploid cells. Thus, during post-natal growth, the liver parenchyma undergoes dramatic changes characterized by gradual polyploidization during which hepatocytes of several ploidy classes emerge as a result of modified cell-division cycles. Liver cell polyploidy is generally considered to indicate terminal differentiation and senescence and to both lead to a progressive loss of cell pluripotency and to a markedly decreased replication capacity. In adults, liver polyploidization is differentially regulated upon loss of liver mass and liver damage. Here we review the current state of understanding about how polyploidization is regulated during normal and pathological liver growth, and detail by which mechanisms hepatocytes become polyploid.},

	abstract = {An analysis was made of cell length and cycle time in time-lapse films of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using wild-type (WT) cells and those of various mutants. The more important conclusions about 'size controls' are: (1) there is a marker in G2 in WT cells provided by a rate change point (RCP) where the linear rate of length growth increases by {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 30\%. The period before this RCP is dependent on size and can be called a 'sizer'. The period after the RCP is nearly independent of size and can be called a 'timer'. The achievement of a critical threshold size is at or near the RCP which is on average at about 0.3 of the cycle (halfway through G2). This is much earlier than was previously believed. (2) The RCP is at about the time when H1 histone kinase activity and the B type cyclin cdc13 start to rise in preparation for mitosis. The RCP is also associated with other metabolic changes. (3) In wee1 mutants, the mitotic size control is replaced by a G1/S size control which is as strong as the mitotic control. As in WT cells, there is a sizer which precedes the RCP followed by a timer but the RCP is at about the G1/S boundary and has a larger increase ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 100\%) in rate. (4) cdc25 is not an essential part of the size control at mitosis or at the G1/S boundary. (5) Three further situations have been examined in which the mitotic size control has been abolished. First, induction synchronisation by block and release of cdc2 and cdc10. In the largest oversize cells which are produced, the RCP is pushed back to the beginning of the cycle. There is no sizer period but only a timer. Second, when both the antagonists wee1 and cdc25 are absent in the double mutant wee1-50 cdc25Δ. In this interesting situation there is apparently no mitotic size control and the cycle times are quantised. Third, in rum1Δ wee1-50 where the normal long G1 in wee1 is much reduced, there is probably no size control either in G1 or in G2 causing a continuous shortening of division length from cycle to cycle.},

	abstract = {© 2015 AACR. Purpose: Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is the first selective cyclindependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor approved for metastatic breast cancer. Hematologic effects, especially neutropenia, are dose-limiting adverse events for palbociclib in humans. Experimental Design: Reversible hematologic effects and bone marrow hypocellularity have been identified in toxicology studies in rats and dogs after palbociclib treatment. To understand the mechanism by which the hematologic toxicity occurs, and to further differentiate it from the myelotoxicity caused by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, an in vitro assay using human bone marrow mononuclear cells (hBMNC) was utilized. Results: This work demonstrated that palbociclib-induced bone marrow suppression occurred through cell-cycle arrest, with no apoptosis at clinically relevant concentrations, was not lineagespecific, and was reversible upon palbociclib withdrawal. In contrast, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel and doxorubicin) resulted in DNAdamage and apoptotic cell death in hBMNCs. In the presence or absence of the antiestrogen, palbociclib- treated hBMNCs did not become senescent and resumed proliferation following palbociclib withdrawal, consistent with pharmacologic quiescence. The breast cancer cells, MCF-7, conversely, became senescent following palbociclib or antiestrogen treatment with additive effects in combination and remained arrested in the presence of antiestrogen. Conclusions: Palbociclib causes reversible bone marrow suppression, clearly differentiating it from apoptotic cell death caused by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. This study also distinguished the cell-cycle arresting action of palbociclib on normal bone marrow cells from the senescent effects observed in breast cancer cells. These results shed light on the mechanism and support risk management of palbociclib-induced bone marrow toxicity in the clinic.},

Using this marker, we observed changes in the nuclear distribution of Dnmt1 during cell cycle progression. Based on the different nuclear distribution of DNA Ligase I and Dnmt1 in G2 and G1, we demonstrate that the combination of both proteins allows the direct discrimination of all cell cycle phases using either immunostainings or fusions with fluorescent proteins.

Here, we provide direct experimental evidence disproving the critical size paradigm. Instead, we show through single-cell microscopy and modeling that the evolutionarily distant bacteria Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus achieve cell size homeostasis by growing, on average, the same amount between divisions, irrespective of cell length at birth. This simple mechanism provides a remarkably robust cell size control without the need of being precise, abating size deviations exponentially within a few generations. This size homeostasis mechanism is broadly applicable for symmetric and asymmetric divisions, as well as for different growth rates. Furthermore, our data suggest that constant size extension is implemented at or close to division. Altogether, our findings provide fundamentally distinct governing principles for cell size and cell-cycle control in bacteria.},

	abstract = {How cell size is determined and maintained remains unclear, even in simple model organisms. In proliferating cells, cell size is regulated by coordinating growth and division through sizer, adder, or timer mechanisms or through some combination [1, 2]. Currently, the best-characterized example of sizer behavior is in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which enters mitosis at a minimal cell size threshold. The peripheral membrane kinase Cdr2 localizes in clusters (nodes) on the medial plasma membrane and promotes mitotic entry [3]. Here, we show that the Cdr2 nodal density, which scales with cell size, is used by the cell to sense and control its size. By analyzing cells of different widths, we first show that cdr2+ cells divide at a fixed cell surface area. However, division in the cdr2Δ mutant is more closely specified by cell volume, suggesting that Cdr2 is essential for area sensing and supporting the existence of a Cdr2-independent secondary sizer mechanism more closely based on volume. To investigate how Cdr2 nodes may sense area, we derive a minimal mathematical model that incorporates the cytoplasmic kinase Ssp1 as a Cdr2 activator. The model predicts that a cdr2 mutant in an Ssp1 phosphorylation site (cdr2-T166A) [4] should form nodes whose density registers cell length. We confirm this prediction experimentally and find that thin cells now follow this new scaling by dividing at constant length instead of area. This work supports the role of Cdr2 as a sizer factor and highlights the importance of studying geometrical aspects of size control.},

	abstract = {CCl4 is proposed to induce cellular injury through its metabolites that are generated by a cytochrome P-450 dependent step. These free radical products can interact with membrane structures, thereby generating lipid peroxides. The latter process has been implicated as a major mechanism of CCl4 hepatoxicity, although this relationship has been difficult to demonstrate when using isolated hepatocyte preparations. This report demonstrates that there are at least two mechanisms by which CCl4 induces injury in isolated hepatocytes. One occurs within minutes of exposure to CCl4 and is characterized by modest malondialdehyde formation and no decline in cellular-reduced glutathione. SKF 525A, metyrapone and promethazine did not protect against this early damage. A second phase of damage, evident particularly after 3 hr, is characterized by a marked increase in malondialdehyde formation, a fall in cellular glutathione and substantial further cellular damage. These changes could be moderated by the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors and promethazine, and antioxidant. Further examination of the initial phase of damage reveals an immediate dose-related inhibition of O2 consumption. This could not be prevented by SKF 525A or metyrapone and was associated with loss of ability to stimulate mitochondrial respiration with dinitrophenol. Rapid recovery to initial O2 consumption rates occurred with time as CCl4 evaporated from the incubation system. This was associated with a partial return of dinitrophenol stimulation of mitochondrial O2 consumption despite significant glutamate dehydrogenase release. A portion of this recovery could be inhibited by SKF 525A, suggesting that some O2 consumption was due to CCl4 metabolism and ensuing lipid peroxidation. These data suggest that early CCl4 toxicity is a direct consequence of its solvent properties and is partially reversible; subsequent damage may be mediated by lipid peroxidation. This solvent injury has not been previously recognized and may have relevance not only to a reversible toxicity as demonstrated with isolated hepatocytes but also in vivo as well.},

We show that Myc and E2f1-3 have little impact on normal G 1 -S transitions. Instead, they synergistically control an S-G 2 transcriptional program required for normal cell divisions and maintaining crypt-villus integrity. Surprisingly, Rb deficiency results in the Myc-dependent accumulation of E2f3 protein and chromatin repositioning of both Myc and E2f3, leading to the a super activation'of a G 1 -S transcriptional program, ectopic S phase entry and rampant cell proliferation. These findings reveal that Rb-deficient cells hijack and redeploy Myc and E2f3 from an S-G 2 program essential for normal cell cycles to a G 1 -S program that re-engages ectopic cell cycles, exposing an unanticipated addiction of Rb-null cells on Myc.},

	abstract = {The Rho GTPases mediate actin rearrangements that are likely to be required for the numerous cell shape changes in a developing embryo. In a genetic screen for Rho signaling pathway components in Drosophila, we identified a gene, DRhoGEF2, that encodes a predicted Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Embryos lacking DRhoGEF2 fail to gastrulate due to a defect in cell shape changes required for tissue invagination, and expression of a dominant-negative Rho GTPase in early embryos results in similar defects. Evidence is also presented that DRhoGEF2 mediates these specific cell shape changes in response to the extracellular ligand, Fog. Together, these results establish a Rho-mediated signaling pathway that is essential for the major morphogenetic events in Drosophila gastrulation.},

	abstract = {The family of E2F transcription factors is the key downstream target of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB), which is frequently inactivated in human cancer. E2F is best known for its role in cell-cycle regulation and triggering apoptosis. However, E2F binds to thousands of genes and, thus, could directly influence a number of biologic processes. Given the plethora of potential E2F targets, the major challenge in the field is to identify specific processes in which E2F plays a functional role and the contexts in which a particular subset of E2F targets dictates a biologic outcome. Recent studies implicated E2F in regulation of expression of mitochondria-associated genes. The loss of such regulation results in severe mitochondrial defects. The consequences become evident during irradiation-induced apoptosis, where E2F-deficient cells are insensitive to cell death despite induction of canonical apoptotic genes. Thus, this novel function of E2F may have a major impact on cell viability, and it is independent of induction of apoptotic genes. Here, we discuss the implications of these findings in cancer biology.},

	doi = {10.18632/oncotarget.14196},
	abstract = {In this report, we systematically examined the role of telomerase activity in lung and ovarian cancer stem cell (CSC) propagation. For this purpose, we indirectly gauged telomerase activity, by linking the hTERT-promoter to eGFP. Using lung (A549) and ovarian (SKOV3) cancer cells, transduced with the hTERT-GFP reporter, we then employed GFP-expression levels to fractionate these cell lines into GFP-high and GFP-low populations. We functionally compared the phenotype of these GFP-high and GFP-low populations. More specifically, we now show that the cancer cells with higher telomerase activity (GFP-high) are more energetically activated, with increased mitochondrial mass and function, as well as increased glycolytic activity. This was further validated and confirmed by unbiased proteomics analysis. Cells with high telomerase activity also showed an increased capacity for stem cell activity (as measured using the 3D-spheroid assay) and cell migration (as measured using a Boyden chamber approach). These enhanced biological phenotypes were effectively inhibited by classical modulators of energy metabolism, which target either i) mitochondrial metabolism (i.e., oligomycin) or ii) glycolysis (i.e., 2-deoxy-glucose), or iii) by using the FDA-approved antibiotic doxycycline, which inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, the level of telomerase activity also determined the ability of hTERT-high cells to proliferate, as assessed by measuring DNA synthesis via EdU incorporation. Consistent with these observations, treatment with an FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD-0332991/palbociclib) specifically blocked the propagation of both lung and ovarian CSCs. Virtually identical results were obtained with breast CSCs, which were also highly sensitive to palbociclib at concentrations in the nanomolar range. In summary, CSCs with high telomerase activity are among the most energetically activated, migratory and proliferative cell sub-populations. These observations may provide a mechanistic explanation for tumor metabolic heterogeneity, based on telomerase activity. FDA-approved drugs, such as doxycycline and palbociclib, were both effective at curtailing CSC propagation. Thus, these FDA-approved drugs could be used to target telomerase-high proliferative CSCs, in multiple cancer types. Finally, our experiments also allowed us to distinguish two different cellular populations of hTERT-high cells, one that was proliferative (i.e., replicative immortality) and the other that was non-proliferative (i.e., quiescent). We speculate that the non-proliferative population of hTERT-high cells that we identified could be mechanistically involved in tumor dormancy.},

After 12 h, the activity of plasma ALT (alanine aminotransferase) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and plasma ALT and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) activities significantly increased 24 h after CCl(4) administration. These results indicated that the necrotic process had initiated at about 12 h and developed thereafter. After 6-24 h of CCl(4) administration, the hepatic level of vitamin C, the most sensitive indicator of oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating that oxidative stress was significantly enhanced 6 h after CCl(4) intoxication and thereafter. Oral administration of vitamin E (1 ml/kg body weight as a 1:1 mixture of alpha-tocopherol and mineral oil) 12 h before CCl(4) administration caused a significant elevation of liver vitamin E level and ameliorated liver necrosis 24 h after CCl(4) intoxication based on plasma AST and ALT. Vitamin E also significantly restored the hepatic vitamin C concentration 12 and 24 h after CCl(4) intoxication, demonstrating that vitamin E functioned as an antioxidant. The liver vitamin E concentration was not changed by vitamin E supplementation to rats that did not receive CCl(4). This result indicated that vitamin E accumulated in the damaged liver. The activation of JNK, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK took place 1.5 h after CCl(4) administration. Co-administration of alpha-tocopherol with CCl(4) did not affect these early changes in MAPKs.},

We report here that in fission yeast, nuclear size is proportional to cell size over a 35-fold range, and use mutants to show that a 16-fold change in nuclear DNA content does not influence the relative size of the nucleus. Multi-nucleated cells with unevenly distributed nuclei reveal that nuclei surrounded by a greater volume of cytoplasm grow more rapidly. During interphase of the cell cycle nuclear growth is proportional to cell growth, and during mitosis there is a rapid expansion of the nuclear envelope. When the nuclear/cell (N/C) volume ratio is increased by centrifugation or genetic manipulation, nuclear growth is arrested while the cell continues to grow; in contrast, low N/C ratios are rapidly corrected by nuclear growth. We propose that there is a general cellular control linking nuclear growth to cell size.},

Here we report that CDC25A is the only family member to provide an essential function during early embryonic development, and that other family members compensate for its loss in adult mice. In contrast, conditional disruption of the entire family is lethal in adults due to a loss of small intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in crypts of Lieberkühn. Cdc25 loss induced Wnt signaling, and overall crypt structures were preserved. In the face of continuous Wnt signaling, nearly all crypt epithelial progenitors differentiated into multiple cell lineages, including crypt base columnar cells, a proposed stem cell. A small population of Musashi/Dcamkl-1/nuclear beta-catenin-positive epithelial cells was retained in these crypts. These findings have implications for the development of novel, less cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic drugs that specifically target the cell cycle.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage plasticity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage plasticity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that Rb1 loss facilitates lineage plasticity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by Pten mutation. Additional loss of Trp53 causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse tumors resemble human prostate cancer neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human tumors exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy. These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate cancer progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate cancer lineage plasticity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.},

In addition, the mutant cells are no longer inhibited by low levels of cycloheximide at any point in G1 but do remain sensitive to serum withdrawal until late in G1. Certain cell cycle-regulated genes showed no temporal or quantitative differences in expression. In contrast, cyclin E expression in Rb-deficient cells is deregulated in two ways. Cyclin E mRNA is generally derepressed in mutant cells and reaches peak levels about 6 h earlier in G1 than in wild-type cells. Moreover, cyclin E protein levels are higher in the Rb(-/-) cells than would be predicted from the levels of its mRNA. Thus, the selective growth advantage conferred by Rb gene deletion during tumorigenesis may be explained in part by changes in the regulation of cyclin E. In addition, the mechanisms defining the restriction point of late G1 may consist of at least two molecular events, one cycloheximide sensitive and pRb dependent and the other serum sensitive and pRb independent.},

Here, we have measured the size of the nucleus in growing cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of mutant yeast strains spanning a range of cell sizes revealed that the ratio of average nuclear volume to average cell volume was quite consistent, with nuclear volume being approximately 7\% that of cell volume. At the single cell level, nuclear and cell size were strongly correlated in growing wild-type cells, as determined by three different microscopic approaches. Even in G1-phase, nuclear volume grew, although it did not grow quite as fast as overall cell volume. DNA content did not appear to have any immediate, direct influence on nuclear size, in that nuclear size did not increase sharply during S-phase. The maintenance of nuclear size did not require continuous growth or ribosome biogenesis, as starvation and rapamycin treatment had little immediate impact on nuclear size. Blocking the nuclear export of new ribosomal subunits, among other proteins and RNAs, with leptomycin B also had no obvious effect on nuclear size. Nuclear expansion must now be factored into conceptual and mathematical models of budding yeast growth and division. These results raise questions as to the unknown force(s) that expand the nucleus as yeast cells grow.},

	abstract = {Throughout development, a series of epithelial movements and fusions occur that collectively shape the embryo. They are dependent on coordinated reorganizations and contractions of the actin cytoskeleton within defined populations of epithelial cells. One paradigm morphogenetic movement, dorsal closure in the Drosophila embryo, involves closure of a dorsal epithelial hole by sweeping of epithelium from the two sides of the embryo over the exposed extraembryonic amnioserosa to form a seam where the two epithelial edges fuse together. The front row cells exhibit a thick actin cable at their leading edge. Here, we test the function of this cable by live analysis of GFP-actin-expressing embryos in which the cable is disrupted by modulating Rho1 signaling or by loss of non-muscle myosin (Zipper) function. We show that the cable serves a dual role during dorsal closure. It is contractile and thus can operate as a "purse string," but it also restricts forward movement of the leading edge and excess activity of filopodia/lamellipodia. Stripes of epithelium in which cable assembly is disrupted gain a migrational advantage over their wild-type neighbors, suggesting that the cable acts to restrain front row cells, thus maintaining a taut, free edge for efficient zippering together of the epithelial sheets.},

The molecular and morphological development of these blastocyst-like vesicles and embryos cultured continuously in cytochalasin D followed the same temporal sequence as untreated controls, indicating that they are similar to normal intact blastocysts despite their decreased number of cells, altered ploidy and the absence of an overt inner cell mass. Since maturation of the embryo can take place in the absence of the intercellular features of compaction, the cellular polarization of blastomeres may be important for initiating the differentiation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm in the normal compacting morula.},

These Axin2-expressing cells constitute the majority of the basal epidermal layer, compete neutrally, and require Wnt/β-catenin signaling to proliferate. The same cells contribute robustly to wound healing, with no requirement for a quiescent stem cell subpopulation. By means of double-labeling RNA in situ hybridization in mice, we showed that the Axin2-expressing cells themselves produce Wnt signals as well as long-range secreted Wnt inhibitors, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of stem cell self-renewal.},

Using quantitative image analysis we show that apical shape fluctuations are driven by the medial cytoskeleton, with periodic foci of contractile myosin and actin travelling across cell apices. Shape changes were mostly anisotropic and neighbouring cells were often, but transiently, organised into strings with parallel deformations. During the early stages of DC, shape fluctuations with long cycle lengths produced no net tissue contraction. Cycle lengths shortened with the onset of net tissue contraction, followed by a damping of fluctuation amplitude. Eventually, fluctuations became undetectable as AS cells contracted rapidly. These transitions were accompanied by an increase in apical myosin, both at cell-cell junctions and medially, the latter ultimately forming a coherent, but still dynamic, sheet across cells. Mutants with increased myosin activity or actin polymerisation exhibited precocious cell contraction through changes in the subcellular localisation of myosin. thickveins mutant embryos, which exhibited defects in the actin cable at the leading edge, showed similar timings of fluctuation damping to the wild type, suggesting that damping is an autonomous property of the AS. Our results suggest that cell shape fluctuations are a property of cells with low and increasing levels of apical myosin, and that medial and junctional myosin populations combine to contract AS cell apices and drive DC.},

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include {\textgreater}10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

Recent studies highlighted an important role for dynamic actomyosin contractions, called pulses, that change cell and tissue shape. Net cell shape change depends on whether cell shape is stabilized, or ratcheted, between pulses. Whether there are different classes of contractile pulses in wild-type embryos and how pulses are spatiotemporally coordinated is unknown. Here we develop a computational framework to identify and classify pulses and determine how pulses are coordinated during invagination of the Drosophila ventral furrow. We demonstrate biased transitions in pulse behaviour, where weak or unratcheted pulses transition to ratcheted pulses. The transcription factor Twist directs this transition, with cells in Twist-depleted embryos exhibiting abnormal reversed transitions in pulse behaviour. We demonstrate that ratcheted pulses have higher probability of having neighbouring contractions, and that ratcheting of pulses prevents competition between neighbouring contractions, allowing collective behaviour.},

	abstract = {Loads on molecular motors regulate and coordinate their function. In a study that directly measures properties of internally strained myosin 2 heads bound to actin, we find that human nonmuscle myosins 2A and 2B show marked load-dependent changes in kinetics of ADP release but not in nucleotide binding. We show that the ADP release rate constant is increased 4-fold by the assisting load on one head and decreased 5-fold (for 2A) or 12-fold (for 2B) by the resisting load on the other. Thus these myosins, especially 2B, have marked mechanosensitivity of product release. By regulating the actin attachment of myosin heads, this provides a basis for energy-efficient tension maintenance without obstructing cellular contractility driven by other motors such as smooth muscle myosin. Whereas forward load accelerates the cycle of interaction with actin, resistive load increases duty ratio to favor tension maintenance by two-headed attachment.},

In this work we explore the interplay between geometry and rigidity in two-dimensional vertex models confined to the surface of a sphere. By considering shapes of cells defined by perimeters whose magnitude depends on geodesic distances and areas determined by spherical polygons, the critical shape index in such models is affected by the size of the cell relative to the radius of the sphere on which it is embedded. This implies that cells can collectively rigidify by growing the size of the sphere, i.e. by tuning the curvature of their domain. Finite-temperature studies indicate that cell motility is affected well away from the zero-temperature transition point.},

While variations in \textit{RB} levels may also provide an important means of controlling RB function in both normal and cancer cells, little is known about the mechanisms regulating \textit{RB} transcription. Here we show that members of the RB and E2F families bind directly to the \textit{RB} promoter. To investigate how the RB/E2F pathway may regulate \textit{Rb} transcription, we generated reporter mice carrying an \textit{eGFP} transgene inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome containing most of the \textit{Rb} gene. Expression of eGFP largely parallels that of \textit{Rb} in transgenic embryos and adult mice. Using these reporter mice and mutant alleles for \textit{Rb}, \textit{p107}, and \textit{p130}, we found that RB family members modulate \textit{Rb} transcription in specific cell populations \textit{in vivo} and in culture. Interestingly, while \textit{Rb} is a target of the RB/E2F pathway in mouse and human cells, \textit{Rb} expression does not strictly correlate with the cell cycle status of these cells. These experiments identify novel regulatory feedback mechanisms within the RB pathway in mammalian cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The ureteric bud is an epithelial tube that undergoes branching morphogenesis to form the renal collecting system. Although development of a normal kidney depends on proper ureteric bud morphogenesis, the cellular events underlying this process remain obscure. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy together with several genetic labeling methods to observe ureteric bud cell behaviors in developing mouse kidneys. We observed an unexpected cell behavior in the branching tips of the ureteric bud, which we term "mitosis-associated cell dispersal." Premitotic ureteric tip cells delaminate from the epithelium and divide within the lumen; although one daughter cell retains a basal process, allowing it to reinsert into the epithelium at the site of origin, the other daughter cell reinserts at a position one to three cell diameters away. Given the high rate of cell division in ureteric tips, this cellular behavior causes extensive epithelial cell rearrangements that may contribute to renal branching morphogenesis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Cells progressing through the cell cycle must commit irreversibly to mitosis without slipping back to interphase before properly segregating their chromosomes. A mathematical model of cell-cycle progression in cell-free egg extracts from frog predicts that irreversible transitions into and out of mitosis are driven by hysteresis in the molecular control system. Hysteresis refers to toggle-like switching behavior in a dynamical system. In the mathematical model, the toggle switch is created by positive feedback in the phosphorylation reactions controlling the activity of Cdc2, a protein kinase bound to its regulatory subunit, cyclin B. To determine whether hysteresis underlies entry into and exit from mitosis in cell-free egg extracts, we tested three predictions of the Novak-Tyson model. (i) The minimal concentration of cyclin B necessary to drive an interphase extract into mitosis is distinctly higher than the minimal concentration necessary to hold a mitotic extract in mitosis, evidence for hysteresis. (ii) Unreplicated DNA elevates the cyclin threshold for Cdc2 activation, indication that checkpoints operate by enlarging the hysteresis loop. (iii) A dramatic "slowing down" in the rate of Cdc2 activation is detected at concentrations of cyclin B marginally above the activation threshold. All three predictions were validated. These observations confirm hysteresis as the driving force for cell-cycle transitions into and out of mitosis.},

We identified 4000-6000 proteins in several non-dividing cell types, corresponding to 9699 unique protein identifications over the entire data set. We observed similar protein half-lives in B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, whereas hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons show substantial differences. Our data set extends and statistically validates the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Moreover, analysis of different proteasome and nuclear pore complex assemblies suggests that their turnover rate is architecture dependent.

To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we performed a large-scale small molecule screen and found that the p38 MAPK pathway is involved in coordinating cell size and cell cycle progression. Small cells display higher p38 activity and spend more time in G1 than larger cells. Inhibition of p38 MAPK leads to loss of the compensatory G1 length extension in small cells, resulting in faster proliferation, smaller cell size and increased size heterogeneity. We propose a model wherein the p38 pathway responds to changes in cell size and regulates G1 exit accordingly, to increase cell size uniformity.},

	abstract = {Malignant mesothelioma (MM) shows frequent inactivation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-tumor-suppressor gene. Recent studies have documented that the Hippo signaling pathway, a downstream cascade of Merlin (a product of NF2), has a key role in organ size control and carcinogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. We previously reported that MMs show overexpression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator, the main downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which results from the inactivation of NF2, LATS2 and/or SAV1 genes (the latter two encoding core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway) or amplification of YAP itself. However, the detailed roles of YAP remain unclear, especially the target genes of YAP that enhance MM cell growth and survival. Here, we demonstrated that YAP-knockdown inhibited cell motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth as well as cell proliferation of MM cells in vitro. We analyzed genes commonly regulated by YAP in three MM cell lines with constitutive YAP-activation, and found that the major subsets of YAP-upregulating genes encode cell cycle regulators. Among them, YAP directly induced the transcription of CCND1 and FOXM1, in cooperation with TEAD transcription factor. We also found that knockdown of CCND1 and FOXM1 suppressed MM cell proliferation, although the inhibitory effects were less evident than those of YAP knockdown. These results indicate that constitutive YAP activation in MM cells promotes cell cycle progression giving more aggressive phenotypes to MM cells. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

We showed that expression in the amnioserosa of proteins that suppress or enhance apoptosis slows or speeds dorsal closure, respectively. These changes correlate with the forces produced by the amnioserosa and the rate of seam formation between the cell sheets (zipping), key processes that contribute to closure. This apoptotic force is used by the embryo to drive cell-sheet movements during development, a role not classically attributed to apoptosis.},

	abstract = {The activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases serve to integrate extracellular signaling during G1 phase with the cell-cycle engine that regulates DNA replication and mitosis. Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3beta can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3beta is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3beta remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3beta in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3beta.},

As pRB is known to repress E2F transcriptional activity and overexpression of E2F is sufficient for cell cycle progression, it is thought that pRB suppresses growth in part by repressing E2F-mediated transcription. Previously, we reported that loss of E2f1 in mice results in tissue-specific tumour induction and tissue atrophy, demonstrating that E2F-1 normally controls growth both positively and negatively in a tissue-specific fashion. To determine whether E2F-1 deregulation–as a result of loss of pRB–promotes proliferation in vivo, we have tested whether loss of E2f1 interferes with the pituitary and thyroid tumorigenesis that occurs in Rb1(+/-) mice. We have found that loss of E2f1 reduces the frequency of pituitary and thyroid tumours, and greatly lengthens the lifespan of Rb1(+/-); E2f1(-/-) animals, demonstrating that E2F-1 is an important downstream target of pRB during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, loss of E2f1 reduces a previously reported strain-dependent difference in Rb1(+/-) lifespan, suggesting that E2f1 or an E2F-1-regulated gene acts as a genetic modifier between the 129/Sv and C57BL/6 strains.},

Why maintenance of a cell-type specific cell size is important remains poorly understood. Here we show that growing budding yeast and primary mammalian cells beyond a certain size impairs gene induction, cell-cycle progression, and cell signaling. These defects are due to the inability of large cells to scale nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis in accordance with cell volume increase, which effectively leads to cytoplasm dilution. We further show that loss of scaling beyond a certain critical size is due to DNA becoming limiting. Based on the observation that senescent cells are large and exhibit many of the phenotypes of large cells, we propose that the range of DNA:cytoplasm ratio that supports optimal cell function is limited and that ratios outside these bounds contribute to aging.},

	abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis is the process in which coordinated movements and shape changes of large numbers of cells form tissues, organs, and the internal body structure. Understanding morphogenetic movements requires precise measurements of whole-cell shape changes over time. Tissue folding and invagination are thought to be facilitated by apical constriction, but the mechanism by which changes near the apical cell surface affect changes along the entire apical-basal axis of the cell remains elusive. Here, we developed Embryo Development Geometry Explorer, an approach for quantifying rapid whole-cell shape changes over time, and we combined it with deep-tissue time-lapse imaging based on fast two-photon microscopy to study Drosophila ventral furrow formation. We found that both the cell lengthening along the apical-basal axis and the movement of the nucleus to the basal side proceeded stepwise and were correlated with apical constriction. Moreover, cell volume lost apically due to constriction largely balanced the volume gained basally by cell lengthening. The volume above the nucleus was conserved during its basal movement. Both apical volume loss and cell lengthening were absent in mutants showing deficits in the contractile cytoskeleton underlying apical constriction. We conclude that a single mechanical mechanism involving volume conservation and apical constriction-induced basal movement of cytoplasm accounts quantitatively for the cell shape changes and the nucleus movement in Drosophila ventral furrow formation. Our study provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the fast dynamics of whole-cell shape changes during tissue folding and points to a simplified model for Drosophila gastrulation.},

	abstract = {An investigation was made of the kinetics of nucleic acid and protein (dry mass) synthesis during interphase of mouse fibroblasts in vitro. Quantitative microspectrophotometric and microinterferometric methods were employed for the determination of the cellular DNA, RNA and mass content. The time course of DNA, RNA and mass synthesis during interphase was obtained by analyzing the distribution of the DNA, RNA and mass content of individual cells from large samples in fixed populations. The main source of error in this type of analysis lies in momentary variation, i.e. variation in the amount of DNA, RNA and mass among cells in the same physiological stage of the cell cycle. The influence of momentary variation on this method of analysis was examined in order to be able to make corrections for it. The accuracy of the results obtained was discussed in relation to sample size and momentary variation. The G1, S and G2 periods were found to be 9, 6 and 4 hr respectively. During the S period DNA was synthesized at a constant rate. Contrary to DNA, RNA and mass were synthesized throughout the whole interphase. The rate of synthesis of both RNA and mass was 2-2.5 times faster at the end of interphase than it was at the beginning. The increase in the rate of RNA synthesis seemed to occur predominantly during the second half of interphase at the same time as the doubling of the amount of DNA in the cell. The rate of mass synthesis, however, seemed to increase over the whole of the interphase period in proportion to the amount of RNA. © 1965.},

	abstract = {Multiplexed quantitation via isobaric chemical tags (e.g., tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative proteomics. However, until recently the utility of these tags was questionable due to reporter ion ratio distortion resulting from fragmentation of coisolated interfering species. These interfering signals can be negated through additional gas-phase manipulations (e.g., MS/MS/MS (MS3) and proton-transfer reactions (PTR)). These methods, however, have a significant sensitivity penalty. Using isolation waveforms with multiple frequency notches (i.e., synchronous precursor selection, SPS), we coisolated and cofragmented multiple MS2 fragment ions, thereby increasing the number of reporter ions in the MS3 spectrum 10-fold over the standard MS3 method (i.e., MultiNotch MS3). By increasing the reporter ion signals, this method improves the dynamic range of reporter ion quantitation, reduces reporter ion signal variance, and ultimately produces more high-quality quantitative measurements. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed biological triplicates of eight colon cancer cell lines using the MultiNotch MS3 method. Across all the replicates we quantified 8,378 proteins in union and 6,168 proteins in common. Taking into account that each of these quantified proteins contains eight distinct cell-line measurements, this data set encompasses 174,704 quantitative ratios each measured in triplicate across the biological replicates. Herein, we demonstrate that the MultiNotch MS3 method uniquely combines multiplexing capacity with quantitative sensitivity and accuracy, drastically increasing the informational value obtainable from proteomic experiments.},

Cells respond to matrix rigidity by moving toward more rigid matrices using an unknown mechanism. In spreading and migrating cells we find local periodic contractions of lamellipodia that depend on matrix rigidity, fibronectin binding and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). These contractions leave periodic rows of matrix bound beta3-integrin and paxillin while generating waves of rearward moving actin bound alpha-actinin and MLCK. The period between contractions corresponds to the time for F-actin to move across the lamellipodia. Shortening lamellipodial width by activating cofilin decreased this period proportionally. Increasing lamellipodial width by Rac signaling activation increased this period. We propose that an actin bound, contraction-activated signaling complex is transported locally from the tip to the base of the lamellipodium, activating the next contraction/extension cycle.},

	abstract = {Apical cell surfaces in metazoan epithelia, such as the wing disc of Drosophila, resemble polygons with different numbers of neighboring cells. The distribution of these polygon numbers has been shown to be conserved. Revealing the mechanisms that lead to this topology might yield insights into how the structural integrity of epithelial tissues is maintained. It has previously been proposed that cell division alone, or cell division in combination with cell rearrangements, is sufficient to explain the observed epithelial topology. Here, we extend this work by including an analysis of the clustering and the polygon distribution of mitotic cells. In addition, we study possible effects of cellular growth regulation by mechanical forces, as such regulation has been proposed to be involved in wing disc size regulation. We formulated several theoretical scenarios that differ with respect to whether cell rearrangements are allowed and whether cellular growth rates are dependent on mechanical stress. We then compared these scenarios with experimental data on the polygon distribution of the entire cell population, that of mitotic cells, as well as with data on mitotic clustering. Surprisingly, we observed considerably less clustering in our experiments than has been reported previously. Only scenarios that include mechanical-stress-dependent growth rates are in agreement with the experimental data. Interestingly, simulations of these scenarios showed a large decrease in rearrangements and elimination of cells. Thus, a possible growth regulation by mechanical force could have a function in releasing the mechanical stress that evolves when all cells have similar growth rates. © 2010.

	abstract = {Transient kinetic methods were used to study interactions between actin, MgADP, and smooth muscle (chicken gizzard) myosin subfragment 1 (smS1). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of actin for smS1 was 3.5 nM, tighter than that of skeletal S1 (skS1). Actin binding to smS1 was weakened 5-fold by saturation with ADP compared to 30-60-fold for skS1. The K(d) of ADP for smS1 was increased from 1.2 to 5 μM by actin, whereas for skS1 values increased from 2 to 100 μM. Thus, coupling between ADP and actin binding is weaker for smS1. Previous studies show that release of ADP from actin. smS1·ADP produces a tilt of the regulatory domain [Whittaker, M., Wilson-Kubalek, E. M., Smith, J. E., Faust, L., Milligan, R. A., and Sweeney, H. L. (1995) Nature 378, 748-751]. This result was confirmed by independent structural methods; tilting was absent for skS1, and the K(d) for ADP was in agreement with the values measured here [Gollub, J., Cremo, C. R., and Cooke, R. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 796-802; Poole, K. I. V., Lorenz, M., Ellison, P., Evans, G., Rosenbaum, G., Boesecke, P., Holmes, K. C., and Cremo, C. R. (1997) J. Muscle Res. Cell Motility 18, 264]. We discuss tilting upon ADP release with respect to our measurements, previous measurements with skS1, and nucleotide concentrations in smooth muscle. We propose that these data suggest a strain-dependent ADP release mechanism that may be accentuated in smooth muscles.},

After pretreatment with a urokinase-expressing adenovirus, these animals could be highly engrafted (up to 90\%) with human hepatocytes from multiple sources, including liver biopsies. Furthermore, human cells could be serially transplanted from primary donors and repopulate the liver for at least four sequential rounds. The expanded cells displayed typical human drug metabolism. This system provides a robust platform to produce high-quality human hepatocytes for tissue culture. It may also be useful for testing the toxicity of drug metabolites and for evaluating pathogens dependent on human liver cells for replication.},

The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho regulates such remodeling, but the underlying mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Cofilin exhibits actin-depolymerizing activity that is inhibited as a result of its phosphorylation by LIM-kinase. Cofilin was phosphorylated in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells during lysophosphatidic acid-induced, Rho-mediated neurite retraction. This phosphorylation was sensitive to Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK. ROCK, which is a downstream effector of Rho, did not phosphorylate cofilin directly but phosphorylated LIM-kinase, which in turn was activated to phosphorylate cofilin. Overexpression of LIM-kinase in HeLa cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers in a Y-27632-sensitive manner. These results indicate that phosphorylation of LIM-kinase by ROCK and consequently increased phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Time series expression experiments are used to study a wide range of biological systems. More than 80\% of all time series expression datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets present unique challenges. On account of the large number of genes profiled (often tens of thousands) and the small number of time points many patterns are expected to arise at random. Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. Results: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data. © The Author 2005.

Here, we show that a recombinant myosin IIA protein that assembles constitutively and is incapable of binding RLC still displays strong localization to the furrow in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this RLC-deficient myosin II efficiently drives cytokinesis, demonstrating that centralspindlin-based RLC phosphorylation is not necessary for myosin II localization during furrowing. Myosin II truncation analysis further reveals two distinct myosin II tail properties that contribute to furrow localization: a central tail domain mediating cortical furrow binding to heterologous binding partners and a carboxyl-terminal region mediating co-assembly with existing furrow myosin IIA or IIB filaments.},

During G1 phase, growth-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity promotes DNA replication and initiates G1-to-S phase transition. CDK activation initiates a positive feedback loop that further increases CDK activity, and this commits the cell to division by inducing genome-wide transcriptional changes. G1-S transcripts encode proteins that regulate downstream cell cycle events. Recent work is beginning to reveal the complex molecular mechanisms that control the temporal order of transcriptional activation and inactivation, determine distinct functional subgroups of genes and link cell cycle-dependent transcription to DNA replication stress in yeast and mammals. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Force-producing convergence (narrowing) and extension (lengthening) of tissues by active intercalation of cells along the axis of convergence play a major role in axial morphogenesis during embryo development in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and failure of these processes in human embryos leads to defects including spina bifida and anencephaly. Here we use Xenopus laevis, a system in which the polarized cell motility that drives this active cell intercalation has been related to the development of forces that close the blastopore and elongate the body axis, to examine the role of myosin IIB in convergence and extension. We find that myosin IIB is localized in the cortex of intercalating cells, and show by morpholino knockdown that this myosin isoform is essential for the maintenance of a stereotypical, cortical actin cytoskeleton as visualized with time-lapse fluorescent confocal microscopy. We show that this actin network consists of foci or nodes connected by cables and is polarized relative to the embryonic axis, preferentially cyclically shortening and lengthening parallel to the axis of cell polarization, elongation and intercalation, and also parallel to the axis of convergence forces during gastrulation. Depletion of MHC-B results in disruption of this polarized cytoskeleton, loss of the polarized protrusive activity characteristic of intercalating cells, eventual loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, and dose-dependent failure of blastopore closure, arguably because of failure to develop convergence forces parallel to the myosin IIB-dependent dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings bridge the gap between a molecular-scale motor protein and tissue-scale embryonic morphogenesis.},

We find that, whereas the actin cortex is largely dispensable for rounding and timely mitotic progression in isolated cells, it is needed to drive rounding to enable unperturbed spindle morphogenesis under conditions of confinement. Using different methods to limit mitotic cell height, we show that a failure to round up causes defects in spindle assembly, pole splitting, and a delay in mitotic progression. These defects can be rescued by increasing microtubule lengths and therefore appear to be a direct consequence of the limited reach of mitotic centrosome-nucleated microtubules. These findings help to explain why most animal cells round up as they enter mitosis.},

In a mixed species comparison with fixed phosphopeptide ratios, we find LFQ and SILAC to be the most accurate techniques. MS2-based TMT yields the highest precision but lowest accuracy due to ratio compression, which MS3-based TMT can partly rescue. However, MS2-based TMT outperforms MS3-based TMT when analyzing phosphoproteome changes in the DNA damage response, since its higher precision and larger identification numbers allow detection of a greater number of significantly regulated phosphopeptides. Finally, we utilize the TMT multiplexing capabilities to develop an algorithm for determining phosphorylation site stoichiometry, showing that such applications benefit from the high accuracy of MS3-based TMT.},

GSK-3beta engages the meiotic kinase network through a double-negative feedback loop; this specific feedback architecture raises the progesterone threshold in correspondence with the strength of double-negative signaling. We also identified a marker of nutritional status, l-leucine, which lowers the progesterone threshold, indicating that oocytes integrate additional signals into their cell-fate decisions by modulating progesterone responsiveness.},

	abstract = {The regulation of organ size constitutes a major unsolved question in developmental biology. The wing imaginal disc of Drosophila serves as a widely used model system to study this question. Several mechanisms have been proposed to have an impact on final size, but they are either contradicted by experimental data or they cannot explain a number of key experimental observations and may thus be missing crucial elements. We have modeled a regulatory network that integrates the experimentally confirmed molecular interactions underlying other available models. Furthermore, the network includes hypothetical interactions between mechanical forces and specific growth regulators, leading to a size regulation mechanism that conceptually combines elements of existing models, and can be understood in terms of a compression gradient model. According to this model, compression increases in the center of the disc during growth. Growth stops once compression levels in the disc center reach a certain threshold and the compression gradient drops below a certain level in the rest of the disc. Our model can account for growth termination as well as for the paradoxical observation that growth occurs uniformly in the presence of a growth factor gradient and non-uniformly in the presence of a uniform growth factor distribution. Furthermore, it can account for other experimental observations that argue either in favor or against other models. The model also makes specific predictions about the distribution of cell shape and size in the developing disc, which we were able to confirm experimentally. © 2012.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The ways in which cells set the size of intracellular structures is an important but largely unsolved problem [1]. Early embryonic divisions pose special problems in this regard. Many checkpoints common in somatic cells are missing from these divisions, which are characterized by rapid reductions in cell size and short cell cycles [2]. Embryonic cells must therefore possess simple and robust mechanisms that allow the size of many of their intracellular structures to rapidly scale with cell size. RESULTS:Here, we study the mechanism by which one structure, the centrosome, scales in size during the early embryonic divisions of C. elegans. We show that centrosome size is directly related to cell size and is independent of lineage. Two findings suggest that the total amount of maternally supplied centrosome proteins could limit centrosome size. First, the combined volume of all centrosomes formed at any one time in the developing embryo is constant. Second, the total volume of centrosomes in any one cell is independent of centrosome number. By increasing the amount of centrosome proteins in the cell, we provide evidence that one component that limits centrosome size is the conserved pericentriolar material protein SPD-2 [3], which we show binds to and targets polo-like kinase 1 [3, 4] to centrosomes. CONCLUSIONS:We propose a limiting component hypothesis, in which the volume of the cell sets centrosome size by limiting the total amount of centrosome components. This idea could be a general mechanism for setting the size of intracellular organelles during development.},

	abstract = {Actomyosin networks linked to the micro-environment through the plasma membrane are thought to be key players in regulating cell behaviors within multicellular tissues, such as converging and extending mesoderm. Here, we observe the dynamics of actin contractions called 'punctuated actin contractions' in the mid-cell body of embryonic mesenchymal cells in the mesoderm. These contraction dynamics are a common feature of Xenopus embryonic tissues and are important for cell shape changes during morphogenesis. Quantitative morphological analysis of these F-actin dynamics indicates that frequent and aligned movements of multiple actin contractions accompany mesoderm cells as they intercalate and elongate. Using inhibitors combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, we find that the dynamics of actin contractions are regulated by both myosin contractility and F-actin polymerization. Furthermore, we find that the non-canonical Wnt-signaling pathway permissively regulates levels of punctuated actin contractions. Overexpression of Xfz7 (Fzd7) can induce early maturation of actin contractions in mesoderm and produce mesoderm-like actin contractions in ectoderm cells. By contrast, expression of the dominant-negative Xenopus disheveled construct Xdd1 blocks the progression of actin contractions into their late mesoderm dynamics but has no effect in ectoderm. Our study reveals punctuated actin contractions within converging and extending mesoderm and uncovers a permissive role for non-canonical Wnt-signaling, myosin contractility and F-actin polymerization in regulating these dynamics.},

Although guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the monomeric G protein Rho (RhoGEFs) are well characterized as effectors of this G protein class, a variety of other downstream targets has been reported. To identify Ga12 determinants that mediate specific protein interactions, we used a structural and evolutionary comparison between the G12/13, Gs, Gi, and Gq classes to identify "class- distinctive" residues in Ga12 and Ga13. Mutation of these residues in Ga12 to their deduced ancestral forms revealed a subset necessary for activation of serum response element (SRE)-mediated transcription, a G12/13-stimulated pathway implicated in cell proliferative signaling. Unexpectedly, this subset of Ga12 mutants showed impaired binding to heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) while retaining binding to RhoGEFs. Corresponding mutants of Gα13 exhibited robust SRE activation, suggesting a Gα12-specific mechanism, and inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin or small interfering RNA-mediated lowering of Hsp90 levels resulted in greater downregulation of Gα12 than Gα13 signaling in SRE activation experiments. Furthermore, the Drosophila G12/13 homolog Concertina was unable to signal to SRE in mammalian cells, and Gα12:Concertina chimeras revealed Gα12-specific determinants of SRE activation within the switch regions and a C-terminal region. These findings identify Gα12 determinants of SRE activation, implicate Gα12:Hsp90 interaction in this signaling mechanism, and illuminate structural features that arose during evolution of Gα12 and Gα13 to allow bifurcated mechanisms of signaling to a common cell proliferative pathway.},

	abstract = {Many organisms lose the capacity to regenerate damaged tissues as they mature. Damaged Drosophila imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (L3) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes wingless (wg) and Wnt6. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing Myc expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including wg, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals.},

	abstract = {Cell shape changes drive tissue morphogenesis during animal development. An important example is the apical cell constriction that initiates tissue internalisation. Apical constriction can occur through a phase of cyclic assembly and disassembly of apicomedial actomyosin networks, followed by stabilisation of these networks. Delayed negative-feedback mechanisms typically underlie cyclic behaviour, but the mechanisms regulating cyclic actomyosin networks remain obscure, as do mechanisms that transform overall network behaviour. Here, we show that a known inhibitor of apicomedial actomyosin networks in Drosophila amnioserosa cells, the Par-6-aPKC complex, is recruited to the apicomedial domain by actomyosin networks during dorsal closure of the embryo. This finding establishes an actomyosin-aPKC negative-feedback loop in the system. Additionally, we find that aPKC recruits Bazooka to the apicomedial domain, and phosphorylates Bazooka for a dynamic interaction. Remarkably, stabilising aPKC-Bazooka interactions can inhibit the antagonism of actomyosin by aPKC, suggesting that Bazooka acts as an aPKC inhibitor, and providing a possible mechanism for delaying the actomyosin-aPKC negative-feedback loop. Our data also implicate an increasing degree of Par-6-aPKC-Bazooka interactions as dorsal closure progresses, potentially explaining a developmental transition in actomyosin behaviour from cyclic to persistent networks. This later impact of aPKC inhibition is supported by mathematical modelling of the system. Overall, this work illustrates how shifting chemical signals can tune actomyosin network behaviour during development.},

Cells experience various spatial and mechanical constraints depending on their environmental context in the body, but we do not fully understand if and how such constraints influence cell cycle progression and thereby proliferation patterns in tissues. Here, we study the impact of mechanical manipulations on the cell cycle of individual cells within a mammalian model epithelium. By monitoring the response to experimentally applied forces, we find a checkpoint at the G1-S boundary that, in response to spatial constraints, controls cell cycle progression. This checkpoint prevents cells from entering S phase if the available space remains below a characteristic threshold because of crowding. Stretching the tissue results in fast cell cycle reactivation, whereas compression rapidly leads to cell cycle arrest. Our kinetic analysis of this response shows that cells have no memory of past constraints and allows us to formulate a biophysical model that predicts tissue growth in response to changes in spatial constraints in the environment. This characteristic biomechanical cell cycle response likely serves as a fundamental control mechanism to maintain tissue integrity and to ensure control of tissue growth during development and regeneration.},

Using live imaging techniques in conjunction with embryos expressing a chimeric Dorsal-GFP, we demonstrate that the redistribution of Dorsal from cytoplasm to nucleus is an extremely dynamic process. Nuclear Dorsal concentration changes continuously over time in all nuclei during interphase. While Dorsal appears to be nuclearly localized primarily in ventral nuclei, it is actively shuttling into and out of all nuclei, including nuclei on the dorsal side. Nuclear export is blocked by leptomycin B, a potent inhibitor of Exportin 1 (CRM1)-mediated nuclear export. We have developed a novel in vivo assay revealing the presence of a functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal within the carboxyterminal 44 amino acids of Dorsal. We also find that diffusion of Dorsal is partially constrained to cytoplasmic islands surrounding individual syncitial nuclei. A model is proposed in which the generation and maintenance of the Dorsal gradient is a consequence of an active process involving both restricted long-range diffusion and the balancing of nuclear import with nuclear export.},

While mitochondrial content increases linearly, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation are highest at intermediate cell sizes. Thus, mitochondrial content and functional scaling are uncoupled. The nonlinearity of mitochondrial functionality is cell size, not cell cycle, dependent, and it results in an optimal cell size whereby cellular fitness and proliferative capacity are maximized. While optimal cell size is controlled by growth factor signaling, its establishment and maintenance requires mitochondrial dynamics, which can be controlled by the mevalonate pathway. Thus, optimization of cellular fitness and functionality through mitochondria can explain the requirement for size control, as well as provide means for its maintenance.},

	abstract = {Mammalian preimplantation embryos enter the S phase immediately after the end of the M phase; their cell cycle lacks a substantial G1 phase. Previously, we suggested that the absence of the G1 phase was attributable to a loss of retinoblastoma protein (RB) function, which is required for suppression of S phase entrance and that this loss of RB function in turn was attributable to the low RB expression level during preimplantation development in mouse embryos. The present study aimed to examine whether or not RB inhibition by CDK4/6-cyclin D-dependent phosphorylation is involved in the loss of RB function in preimplantation mouse embryos by the expression of p16(INK4a), a potent endogenous inhibitor of CDK4/6-cyclin D. First, the decrease in RB expression between the four-cell and morula stages was confirmed in in vivo-derived mouse embryos. We then examined the efficiency of the p16(INK4a) expression vector in inhibiting RB phosphorylation and cell cycle progression using NIH-3T3 cells and obtained gradual RB dephosphorylation and a significantly lower proliferation rate in p16(INK4a)-transfected cells than in control cells. This indicated the successful p16(INK4a) effects on cell-cycle progression by the vector used. On the other hand, the development rate of mouse embryos injected with the p16(INK4a) expression vector was the same as that of the control embryos, although p16(INK4a) expression was detected at mRNA and protein levels in the former group but not in the control group. These results suggest that RB phosphorylation is not involved in RB dysfunction or in the lack of a G1 phase in mouse embryos and that the decrease in RB expression is important for preimplantation-embryo-specific cell-cycle regulation. Moreover, the present study indicates the similarity between preimplantation embryos and cancer cells, which p16(INK4a) expression does not arrest at the G1 phase.},

Conditional loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in mice permits hepatocyte growth without cell division, allowing us to study cell size in vivo using transcriptomics and metabolomics. RESULTS:Larger cells displayed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes but unexpectedly repressed expression of many genes involved in mitochondrial functions. This effect appears to be cell autonomous because cultured Drosophila cells induced to increase cell size displayed a similar gene-expression pattern. Larger hepatocytes also displayed a reduction in the expression of lipogenic transcription factors, especially sterol-regulatory element binding proteins. Inhibition of mitochondrial functions and lipid biosynthesis, which is dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, increased the cell size with reciprocal effects on cell proliferation in several cell lines. CONCLUSIONS:We uncover that large cell-size increase is accompanied by downregulation of mitochondrial gene expression, similar to that observed in diabetic individuals. Mitochondrial metabolism and lipid synthesis are used to couple cell size and cell proliferation. This regulatory mechanism may provide a possible mechanism for sensing metazoan cell size.},

	abstract = {Collective cell migration is key to morphogenesis, wound healing, or cancer cell migration. However, its cellular bases are just starting to be unraveled. During vertebrate gastrulation, axial mesendoderm migrates in a group, the prechordal plate, from the embryonic organizer to the animal pole. How this collective migration is achieved remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that cells migrate as individuals, with collective movement resulting from the addition of similar individual cell behavior. Through extensive analyses of cell trajectories, morphologies, and polarization in zebrafish embryos, we reveal that all prechordal plate cells show the same behavior and rely on the same signaling pathway to migrate, as expected if they do so individually. However, by using cell transplants, we demonstrate that prechordal plate migration is a true collective process, as isolated cells do not migrate toward the animal pole. They are still polarized and motile but lose directionality. Directionality is restored upon contact with the endogenous prechordal plate. This contact dependent orientation relies on E-cadherin, Wnt-PCP signaling, and Rac1. Importantly, groups of cells also need contact with the endogenous plate to orient correctly, showing an instructive role of the plate in establishing directionality. Overall, our results lead to an original model of collective migration in which directional information is contained within the moving group rather than provided by extrinsic cues, and constantly maintained in cells by contacts with their neighbors. This self-organizing model could account for collective invasion of new territories, as observed in cancer strands, without requirement for any attractant in the colonized tissue.},

Microtubules and F-actin are considered to be two of the most important structural elements within living cells accounting for both force production and mechanical stiffness. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of microtubules to the stiffness of converging and extending dorsal tissues in Xenopus laevis embryos using cell biological, biophysical and embryological techniques. Surprisingly, we discovered that depolymerizing microtubules stiffens embryonic tissues by three- to fourfold. We attribute tissue stiffening to Xlfc, a previously identified RhoGEF, which binds microtubules and regulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Combining drug treatments and Xlfc activation and knockdown lead us to the conclusion that mechanical properties of tissues such as viscoelasticity can be regulated through RhoGTPase pathways and rule out a direct contribution of microtubules to tissue stiffness in the frog embryo. We can rescue nocodazole-induced stiffening with drugs that reduce actomyosin contractility and can partially rescue morphogenetic defects that affect stiffened embryos. We support these conclusions with a multi-scale analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics, tissue-scale traction and measurements of tissue stiffness to separate the role of microtubules from RhoGEF activation. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of the effects of nocodazole and increased focus on the role of Rho family GTPases as regulators of the mechanical properties of cells and their mechanical interactions with surrounding tissues.},

Here we demonstrate WNT-mediated intercellular coupling between the cell cycle and circadian clock in 3D murine intestinal organoids (enteroids). The circadian clock gates a population of cells with heterogeneous cell-cycle times that emerge as 12-hr synchronized cell division cycles. Remarkably, we observe reduced-amplitude oscillations of circadian rhythms in intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells, indicating an intercellular signal arising from differentiated cells governing circadian clock-dependent synchronized cell division cycles. Stochastic simulations and experimental validations reveal Paneth cell-secreted WNT as the key intercellular coupling component linking the circadian clock and cell cycle in enteroids.},

In Drosophila, single genes for Cyclin D and Cdk4 have been identified, simplifying genetic analysis. Here, we show that Drosophila Cdk4 interacts with Cyclin D and the Rb homolog RBF as expected, but is not absolutely essential. Flies homozygous for null mutations develop to the adult stage and are fertile, although only to a very limited degree. Overexpression of inactive mutant Cdk4, which is able to bind Cyclin D, does not enhance the Cdk4 mutant phenotype, confirming the absence of additional Cyclin D-dependent cdks. Our results indicate, therefore, that progression into and through the cell cycle can occur in the absence of Cdk4. However, the growth of cells and of the organism is reduced in Cdk4 mutants, indicating a role of D-type cyclin-dependent protein kinases in the modulation of growth rates.},

Here we use a suspended microchannel resonator to monitor the volume and density of single cells in suspension with a precision of 1\% and 0.03\%, respectively. We find that for transformed murine lymphocytic leukemia and mouse pro–B cell lymphoid cell lines, mitotic cells reversibly increase their volume by more than 10\% and decrease their density by 0.4\% over a 20-min period. This response is correlated with the mitotic cell cycle but is not coupled to nuclear osmolytes released by nuclear envelope breakdown, chromatin condensation, or cytokinesis and does not result from endocytosis of the surrounding fluid. Inhibiting Na-H exchange eliminates the response. Although mitotic rounding of adherent cells is necessary for proper cell division, our observations that suspended cells undergo reversible swelling during mitosis suggest that regulation of intracellular water may be a more general component of mitosis than previously appreciated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We demonstrate that cell competition is executed via induction of the proapoptotic gene hid and that both competition and hid function are required for the wing to reach an appropriate size when dMyc is expressed. Moreover, we provide evidence that reproducible wing size during normal development requires apoptosis. Modulating dmyc levels to create cell competition and hid-dependent cell death may be a mechanism used during normal development to control organ size.},

Initially, the murine models were developed with the intent to mirror the human disease for pathophysiologic and therapeutic studies. However, it soon became apparent that Fah-positive hepatocytes have a potent selective growth advantage in mutant liver and can extensively repopulate the diseased organ. For this reason, Fah mutant mice have become a workhorse for liver biology and are widely used in liver stem cell and hepatic gene therapy research. Immune deficient Fah-knockout mice can be repopulated with human hepatocytes, creating "mice with human livers". These chimeric animals have become an important preclinical model for infectious diseases, metabolism and gene therapy. The potent expansion of human hepatocytes in Fah knockout mice has given rise to the concept of using Fah mutants as living bioreactors to produce large quantities of fully mature hepatocytes. As a consequence, larger animal models of Fah deficiency have recently been developed.},

	abstract = {Despite the recent progress in the description of the molecular mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation controls in vitro, the regulation of the homeostasis of normal stratified epithelia remains unclear in vivo. Computer simulation represents a powerful tool to investigate the complex field of cell proliferation regulation networks. It provides huge computation capabilities to test, in a dynamic in silico context, hypotheses about the many pathways and feedback loops involved in cell growth and proliferation controls. Our approach combines a model of cell proliferation and a spatial representation of cells in 2D using the Voronoi graph. The cell proliferation model includes intracellular (cyclins, Cyclin Dependent Kinases - CDKs, Retinoblastoma protein - Rb, CDK inhibitors) and extracellular controls (growth and differentiation factors, integrins). The Voronoi graph associates a polygon with every cell and the set of these polygons defines the tissue architecture. Thus, the model provides a quantitative model of extracellular signals and cell motility as a function of the neighborhood during time dependent simulations. The 2D simulations illustrate the influence of the microenvironment on cell proliferation in basal layers of stratified epithelia and of differential adherence in keratinocytes differentiation and related upward migration. Our results particularly show the role of CDK inhibitors (mainly the protein p27) in the Rb dependent control pathway of the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle.},

After initial growth suppression, there is a rapid increase in growth rate during the G1 phase, followed by a period of constant exponential growth.

	abstract = {© 2015. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of receptors in many organisms, including worms, mice and humans. GPCRs are seven-transmembrane pass proteins that are activated by binding a stimulus (or ligand) in the extracellular space and then transduce that information to the inside of the cell through conformational changes. The conformational changes activate heterotrimeric G-proteins, which execute the downstream signaling pathways through the recruitment and activation of cellular enzymes. The highly specific ligand-GPCR interaction prompts an efficient cellular response, which is vital for the health of the cell and organism. In this Commentary, we review general features of GPCR signaling and then focus on the Drosophila GPCRs, which are not as wellcharacterized as their worm and mammalian counterparts. We discuss findings that the Drosophila odorant and gustatory receptors are not bona fide GPCRs as is the case for their mammalian counterparts. We also present here a phylogenetic analysis of the bona fide Drosophila GPCRs that suggest potential roles for several family members. Finally, we discuss recently discovered roles of GPCRs in Drosophila embryogenesis, a field we expect will uncover many previously unappreciated functions for GPCRs.},

In this work, we have studied how p38α down-regulation affects hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy, focusing on mitotic progression, cytokinesis and oxidative stress. We found that p38α deficiency triggered up-regulation of cyclins A1, B1, B2, and D1 under basal conditions and after hepatectomy. Moreover, p38α-deficient hepatocytes showed enhanced binucleation and increased levels of phospho-histone H3 but impaired phosphorylation of MNK1 after hepatectomy. The recovery of liver mass was transiently delayed in mice with p38α-deficient hepatocytes vs wild type mice. We also found that p38α deficiency caused glutathione oxidation in the liver, increased plasma aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase activities, and decreased plasma protein levels after hepatectomy. Interestingly, p38α silencing in isolated hepatocytes markedly decreased phospho-MNK1 levels, and silencing of either p38α or Mnk1 enhanced binucleation of hepatocytes in culture. In conclusion, p38α deficiency impairs mitotic progression in hepatocytes and restrains the recovery of liver mass after partial hepatectomy. Our results also indicate that p38α regulates cytokinesis by activating MNK1 and redox modulation.},

	abstract = {In physics, it is customary to represent the fluctuations of a stochastic system at steady state in terms of linear response to small random perturbations. Previous work has shown that the same framework describes effectively the trade-off between cell-to-cell variability and correction in the control of cell division of single E. coli cells. However, previous analyses were motivated by specific models and limited to a subset of the measured variables. For example, most analyses neglected the role of growth rate variability. Here, we take a comprehensive approach and consider several sets of available data from both microcolonies and microfluidic devices in different growth conditions. We evaluate all the coupling coefficients between the three main measured variables (interdivision times, cell sizes and individual-cell growth rates). The linear-response framework correctly predicts consistency relations between a priori independent experimental measurements, which confirms its validity. Additionally, the couplings between the cell-specific growth rate and the other variables are typically non zero. Finally, we use the framework to detect signatures of mechanisms in experimental data involving growth rate fluctuations, finding that (1) noise-generating coupling between size and growth rate is a consequence of inter-generation growth rate correlations and (2) the correlation patterns agree with a near-adder model where the added size has a dependence on the single-cell growth rate. Our findings define relevant constraints that any theoretical description should reproduce, and will help future studies aiming to falsify some of the competing models of the cell cycle existing today in the literature.},

	abstract = {One of the most prominent features at the mid-blastula transition (MBT) observed in most embryos is a pause in cell cycle regulated by the nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. By using chromosome rearrangements to manipulate the DNA content of embryos, we determined that the threshold for this cell cycle pause in Drosophila is about 70\% of the DNA content normally present at cycle 14. Embryos with DNA contents around this value show intermediate cell cycle behaviors. Some pause at cycle 14, some at cycle 15, and some form patches arrested in different mitotic cycles. A second feature at MBT is a massive increase in zygotic transcription and a parallel degradation of maternally supplied RNAs. To determine whether these changes in gene expression are governed by the same N/C ratio that controls cell cycle pause, we compared gene expression in haploid and diploid Drosophila embryos. We find that most maternal RNA degradation and most new transcription correlate with absolute time or developmental stage, and are timed independently of the N/C ratio. We identify a class of zygotically active genes whose expression depends on the N/C ratio and which are only expressed at cycle 15 in haploids. In embryos with patchy cell cycle behavior due to threshold DNA contents, the expression of these genes correlates tightly with the boundaries of the mitotic patches, suggesting either that the mechanism that pauses the mitotic cycle is the same as the one that measures the N/C ratio, or that it is tightly coupled to the mechanism controlling zygotic transcription of N/C ratio genes at the MBT.},

We find that as cells grow, mRNAs for some cell-cycle activators scale faster than size, increasing in concentration, while mRNAs for some inhibitors scale slower than size, decreasing in concentration. Size-scaled gene expression could cause an increasing ratio of activators to inhibitors with size, triggering cell-cycle entry. Consistent with this, expression of the CLN2 activator from the promoter of the WHI5 inhibitor, or vice versa, interfered with cell size homeostasis, yielding a broader distribution of cell sizes. We suggest that size homeostasis comes from differential scaling of gene expression with size.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The p21Cip1 protein is a potent stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and p21Cip1 mRNA expression is localized to the nonproliferative compartment of the intestinal villus, suggesting an in vivo growth-inhibitory role in the gut. The authors determined whether nontransformed rat intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) underwent reversible cell cycle arrest by contact inhibition, and determined whether increases in the relative amount of p21 associated with cyclin D/Cdk4 protein complexes were associated with cell growth arrest. METHODS:Density arrest was achieved by prolonged culture IEC-6 in confluent conditions (5 or more days). Release from density arrest was achieved by detaching the cells from the culture plate and reseeding them at a 1:4 ratio. The DNA synthesis was estimated by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and expressed as mean plus or minus standard error of the mean (n = 4). Cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p21 mRNA and protein levels were determined by standard Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p21 protein complex formation was analyzed by immunoprecipitating the complexes from cell lysates with an antibody to one of the constituents, followed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis of the precipitated complexes using antibodies to the other proteins. The kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated Cdk4 was determined using recombinant Rb as substrate. RESULTS:The IEC-6[3H]-thymidine incorporation was decreased 7.5-fold from day 1 confluence to day 7 of confluence. Twenty-four hours after release from density arrest, there was a 43-fold increase in [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Cyclin D1 and Cdk4 mRNA levels remained relatively constant during contact inhibition, whereas immunoblotting showed that the levels of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 proteins decreased by 70.9\% and 68.7\%, respectively, comparing day 3 with day 9 during density arrest. The levels of cyclin D1 increased 5.8-fold and Cdk4 increased by 4.4-fold by 24 hours after reseeding the day 9 density-arrested cultures, coincident with the increase in DNA synthesis. The amount of p21 associated with the cyclin D1 and Cdk4 complex in the density-arrested cells was 170\% of that observed in the reseeded, proliferating cells. More important, the p21::Cdk4 ratio was 6.4-fold higher in the density-arrested (quiescent) cells as compared with rapidly proliferating cells by 24 hours after release from growth arrest. Recovery of Cdk4-dependent kinase activity occurred by 4 hours after release from growth arrest, coincident with decreased binding of p21 to the complex. CONCLUSIONS:Intestinal epithelial cells in culture can undergo density-dependent growth arrest. This process involves downregulation of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 at the level of protein expression, whereas the mRNA levels remain relatively unchanged. Further, during contact inhibition, there is more p21 associated with cyclin D1/Cdk4, which further contributes to the inhibition of the kinase complex. The authors also have shown that the process of contact inhibition is reversible, which may explain partly the ability of the intestinal epithelium to increase proliferative activity in response to injury.},

This surgical technique was first described in rats and requires modification for application in mice. Lack of standardization of 2/3 PH in mice has caused discrepancies in the results obtained in different laboratories. Here, we provide a protocol and a movie describing a straightforward surgical technique, which takes 15-20 min, to consistently remove two-thirds of the liver in mice. As this protocol is not associated with mortality and gives highly reproducible results, we hope that it will be widely used and serve to standardize 2/3 PH in mice.},

As a result, large cells grow, divide and age dramatically faster than small cells. Conversely, small cell mutants age slowly and are long-lived. Investigation of the mechanisms involved suggests that attainment of a maximal size modulates lifespan. Indeed, cumulative results revealed that life expectancy is size-dependent, and that the rate at which cells age is determined in large part by the amount of cell growth per generation.},

Frequency, but not amplitude, of ERK activity pulses exhibited a bell-shaped response to the cell density and correlated with cell proliferation rates. Consistently, synthetic ERK activity pulses generated by a light-switchable CRaf protein accelerated cell proliferation. A mathematical model clarified that 80\% and 20\% of ERK activity pulses are generated by the noise and cell-to-cell propagation, respectively. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis of cells subjected to the synthetic ERK activity pulses suggested the involvement of serum responsive factor (SRF) transcription factors in the gene expression driven by the ERK activity pulses. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Deletion of the retinoblastoma protein rescued the increased size displayed by erythrocytes lacking Cdk2 and Cdk4, indicating that the retinoblastoma/Cdk2/Cdk4 pathway regulates erythrocyte size. The recovery of platelet counts following a 5-fluorouracil challenge was delayed in Cdk2fl/flCdk4-/-vavCre mice revealing a critical role for Cdk2 and Cdk4 in stress hematopoiesis.

	abstract = {Mammalian cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes have been characterized as growth factor-responsive cell cycle regulators. Their levels rise upon growth factor stimulation, and they can phosphorylate and thus neutralize Retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins to promote an E2F-dependent transcriptional program and S-phase entry. Here we characterize the in vivo function of Drosophila Cyclin D (CycD). We find that Drosophila CycD-Cdk4 does not act as a direct G(1)/S-phase regulator, but instead promotes cellular growth (accumulation of mass). The cellular response to CycD-Cdk4-driven growth varied according to cell type. In undifferentiated proliferating wing imaginal cells, CycD-Cdk4 caused accelerated cell division (hyperplasia) without affecting cell cycle phasing or cell size. In endoreplicating salivary gland cells, CycD-Cdk4 caused excessive DNA replication and cell enlargement (hypertrophy). In differentiating eyes, CycD-Cdk4 caused cell enlargement (hypertrophy) in post-mitotic cells. Interaction tests with a Drosophila Rb homolog, RBF, indicate that CycD-Cdk4 can counteract the cell cycle suppressive effects of RBF, but that its growth promoting activity is mediated at least in part via other targets.},

	abstract = {In budding yeast, commitment to cell division corresponds to activating the positive feedback loop of G1 cyclins controlled by the transcription factors SBF and MBF. This pair of transcription factors has over 200 targets, implying that cell-cycle commitment coincides with genome-wide changes in transcription. Here, we find that genes within this regulon have a well-defined distribution of transcriptional activation times. Combinatorial use of SBF and MBF results in a logical OR function for gene expression and partially explains activation timing. Activation of G1 cyclin expression precedes the activation of the bulk of the G1/S regulon, ensuring that commitment to cell division occurs before large-scale changes in transcription. Furthermore, we find similar positive feedback-first regulation in the yeasts S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae, as well as human cells. The widespread use of the feedback-first motif in eukaryotic cell-cycle control, implemented by nonorthologous proteins, suggests its frequent deployment at cellular transitions.},

	abstract = {How mammalian cells regulate their physical size is currently poorly understood, in part due to the difficulty in accurately quantifying cell volume in a high-throughput manner. Here, using the fluorescence exclusion method, we demonstrate that the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) are regulators of single-cell volume. The role of YAP/TAZ in volume regulation must go beyond its influence on total cell cycle duration or cell shape to explain the observed changes in volume. Moreover, for our experimental conditions, volume regulation by YAP/TAZ is independent of mTOR. Instead, we find that YAP/TAZ directly impacts the cell division volume, and YAP is involved in regulating intracellular cytoplasmic pressure. Based on the idea that YAP/TAZ is a mechanosensor, we find that inhibiting myosin assembly and cell tension slows cell cycle progression from G1 to S. These results suggest that YAP/TAZ may be modulating cell volume in combination with cytoskeletal tension during cell cycle progression.},

Polyploidization can be developmentally programmed or stress induced, and arises from either cell-cell fusion or a process known as endoreplication, in which cells replicate their DNA but either fail to complete cytokinesis or to progress through M phase entirely. Polyploidization offers cells several potential fitness benefits, including the ability to increase cell size and biomass production without disrupting cell and tissue structure, and allowing improved cell longevity through higher tolerance to genomic stress and apoptotic signals. Accordingly, recent studies have uncovered crucial roles for polyploidization in compensatory cell growth during tissue regeneration in the heart, liver, epidermis and intestine. Here, we review current knowledge of the molecular pathways that generate polyploidy and discuss how polyploidization is used in tissue repair and regeneration.},

We found that the amino acid composition of synthesized proteins is as important a determinant of translation elongation rate as parameters related to codon and transfer RNA (tRNA) adaptation. We did not find evidence of ribosome collisions curbing the protein output of yeast transcripts, either in high translation conditions associated with exponential growth, or in strains in which deletion of individual ribosomal protein (RP) genes leads to globally increased or decreased translation. Slow translation elongation is characteristic of RP-encoding transcripts, which have markedly lower protein output compared with other transcripts with equally high ribosome densities.},

We have investigated the effects that the DNA-to-protein ratio has on both total transcription and the transcription of individual genes in the unicellular eukaryote fission yeast. Mutants altered in cell size and those blocked in cell-cycle progression were used to vary the DNA-to-protein ratio over a 5-fold range. We found that cells of sizes within 2-fold of the wild-type value regulated global transcription to maintain similar transcription rates per protein regardless of the cellular DNA content. These changes in total transcription correlated with coordinated changes in gene occupancy by RNA polymerase II. In cell-cycle-arrested mutants exceeding a certain size, total transcription rates plateaued as DNA became limiting for transcription at low DNA-to-protein ratios [1]. Unexpectedly, expression levels of individual genes remained tightly coordinated with each other over the entire range of cell sizes. We propose that there is a coordinated, global control that determines the rate of transcription of most genes and that this control plays a role in regulating growth rate of the cell.},

	abstract = {Morphogen gradients are established by the localized production and subsequent diffusion of signaling molecules. It is generally assumed that cell fates are induced only after morphogen profiles have reached their steady state. Yet, patterning processes during early development occur rapidly, and tissue patterning may precede the convergence of the gradient to its steady state. Here we consider the implications of pre-steady-state decoding of the Bicoid morphogen gradient for patterning of the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. Quantitative analysis of the shift in the expression domains of several Bicoid targets (gap genes) upon alteration of bcd dosage, as well as a temporal analysis of a reporter for Bicoid activity, suggest that a transient decoding mechanism is employed in this setting. We show that decoding the pre-steady-state morphogen profile can reduce patterning errors caused by fluctuations in the rate of morphogen production. This can explain the surprisingly small shifts in gap and pair-rule gene expression domains observed in response to alterations in bcd dosage.},

	abstract = {Most genetic changes that promote tumorigenesis involve dysregulation of G1 cell cycle progression. A key regulatory site in G1 is a growth factor-dependent restriction point (R) where cells commit to mitosis. In addition to the growth factor-dependent "R," which maps to a site about 3.5 hours after mitosis, there is another checkpoint later in G1 that is dependent on nutritional sufficiency that has also been referred to as R. However, this second site in late G1 can be distinguished both temporally and genetically from R. We are proposing that the late G1 regulatory site be more appropriately referred to as a "cell growth" checkpoint to distinguish it from R. This checkpoint, which likely has an evolutionary relationship to the yeast cell cycle checkpoint START, is regulated by signals governed by mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin. This review summarizes evidence that distinguishes R from the proposed cell growth checkpoint. Since both checkpoints are dysregulated in most, if not all, human cancers, distinguishing between these 2 distinct G1 regulatory checkpoints has significance for rational therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic signals. © The Author(s) 2011.},

	abstract = {As epithelial tissues develop, groups of cells related by descent tend to associate in clonal populations rather than dispersing within the cell layer. While this is frequently assumed to be a result of differential adhesion, precise mechanisms controlling clonal cohesiveness remain unknown. Here we employ computational simulations to modulate epithelial cell size in silico and show that junctions between small cells frequently collapse, resulting in clone-cell dispersal among larger neighbors. Consistent with similar dynamics in vivo, we further demonstrate that mosaic disruption of Drosophila Tor generates small cells and results in aberrant clone dispersal in developing wing disc epithelia. We propose a geometric basis for this phenomenon, supported in part by the observation that soap-foam cells exhibit similar size-dependent junctional rearrangements. Combined, these results establish a link between cell-size pleomorphism and the control of epithelial cell packing, with potential implications for understanding tumor cell dispersal in human disease.},

	abstract = {The molecular networks regulating the G1-S transition in budding yeast and mammals are strikingly similar in network structure. However, many of the individual proteins performing similar network roles appear to have unrelated amino acid sequences, suggesting either extremely rapid sequence evolution, or true polyphyly of proteins carrying out identical network roles. A yeast/mammal comparison suggests that network topology, and its associated dynamic properties, rather than regulatory proteins themselves may be the most important elements conserved through evolution. However, recent deep phylogenetic studies show that fungal and animal lineages are relatively closely related in the opisthokont branch of eukaryotes. The presence in plants of cell cycle regulators such as Rb, E2F and cyclins A and D, that appear lost in yeast, suggests cell cycle control in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes was implemented with this set of regulatory proteins. Forward genetics in non-opisthokonts, such as plants or their green algal relatives, will provide direct information on cell cycle control in these organisms, and may elucidate the potentially more complex cell cycle control network of the last common eukaryotic ancestor. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that p38 MAPK, which is classified as a stress-activated kinase, also participates in cell cycle regulation, functioning as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We conducted a study of p38 MAPK phosphorylation during liver regeneration in mice to determine whether p38 MAPK activation or inactivation may correlate with events that lead to DNA replication after partial hepatectomy (PH), and whether p38 MAPK activation may be required for hepatocyte DNA replication in vivo and in culture. We report that active p38 (Pi-p38 MAPK) is present in normal liver, is rapidly inactivated starting 30 min after PH, and is re-activated by 12h. Although levels of Pi-MKK 3/6, the upstream kinases that activate p38 MAPK increase after PH, the expression of the dual protein phosphatase 1 is also elevated, and may be responsible for Pi-p38 MAPK dephosphorylation after PH. Inactivation and re-activation of p38 MAPK inversely correlates with the stimulation of protein synthesis and translation pathways, as indicated by activation of p70S6 kinase, increases in the phosphorylation of initiation factor elF-4E and translational repressor, 4E-BP. The activity of a p38 MAPK downstream substrate, MAPKAPK2 (MK2), did not reflect the changing levels of Pi-p38 MAPK during liver regeneration. Pi-p38 MAPK may be involved in TNF-stimulated DNA replication of murine hepatocytes in culture, but is not necessary for hepatocyte DNA replication after PH. Our results suggest that p38 MAPK inactivation plays a permissible role in DNA replication during liver regeneration and is consistent with a role for p38 MAPK in the maintenance of hepatocyte cell cycle arrest in adult liver.},

	abstract = {Interstitial flow in and around tumor tissue affects the mechanical microenvironment to modulate tumor cell growth and metastasis. We investigated the roles of flow-induced shear stress in modulating cell cycle distribution in four tumor cell lines and the underlying mechanisms. In all four cell lines, incubation under static conditions for 24 or 48 h led to G(0)/G(1) arrest; in contrast, shear stress (12 dynes/cm(2)) induced G(2)/M arrest. The molecular basis of the shear effect was analyzed, and the presentation on molecular mechanism is focused on human MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Shear stress induced increased expressions of cyclin B1 and p21(CIP1) and decreased expressions of cyclins A, D1, and E, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk)-1, -2, -4, and -6, and p27(KIP1) as well as a decrease in Cdk1 activity. Using specific antibodies and small interfering RNA, we found that the shear-induced G(2)/M arrest and corresponding changes in G(2)/M regulatory protein expression and activity were mediated by alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrins through bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA-specific Smad1 and Smad5. Shear stress also down-regulated runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) binding activity and osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expressions in MG63 cells; these responses were mediated by alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrins through Smad5. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism by which shear stress induces G(2)/M arrest in tumor cells and inhibits cell differentiation and demonstrate the importance of mechanical microenvironment in modulating molecular signaling, gene expression, cell cycle, and functions in tumor cells.},

	abstract = {The 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of mRNAs contains elements that affect expression, yet the rules by which these regions exert their effect are poorly understood. Here, we studied the impact of 5'-UTR sequences on protein levels in yeast, by constructing a large-scale library of mutants that differ only in the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a fluorescent reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for over 2,000 unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned an approximately sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating the powerful consequences of sequence manipulations of even 1-10 nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon. We devised computational models that predicted over 70\% of the measured expression variability in held-out sequence variants. Notably, a combined model of the most prominent features successfully explained protein abundance in an additional, independently constructed library, whose nucleotide composition differed greatly from the library used to parameterize the model. Our analysis reveals the dominant contribution of the start codon context at positions -3 to -1, mRNA secondary structure, and out-of-frame upstream AUGs (uAUGs) to phenotypic diversity, thereby advancing our understanding of how protein levels are modulated by 5'-UTR sequences, and paving the way toward predictably tuning protein expression through manipulations of 5'-UTRs.},

	abstract = {The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple and inexpensive parameter, which reflects the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume (conventionally known as anisocytosis), and is traditionally used in laboratory hematology for differential diagnosis of anemias. Nonetheless, recent evidence attests that anisocytosis is commonplace in human disorders such as cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, cancer, diabetes, community-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver and kidney failure, as well as in other acute or chronic conditions. Despite some demographic and analytical issues related to the routine assessment that may impair its clinical usefulness, an increased RDW has a high negative predictive value for diagnosing a variety of disorders, but also conveys important information for short- and long-term prognosis. Even more importantly, the value of RDW is now being regarded as a strong and independent risk factor for death in the general population. Although it has not been definitely established whether an increased value of RDW is a risk factor or should only be considered an epiphenomenon of an underlying biological and metabolic imbalance, it seems reasonable to suggest that the assessment of this parameter should be broadened far beyond the differential diagnosis of anemias. An increased RDW mirrors a profound deregulation of erythrocyte homeostasis involving both impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, which may be attributed to a variety of underlying metabolic abnormalities such as shortening of telomere length, oxidative stress, inflammation, poor nutritional status, dyslipidemia, hypertension, erythrocyte fragmentation and alteration of erythropoietin function. As such, the aim of this article is to provide general information about RDW and its routine assessment, to review the most relevant implications in health and disease and give some insights about its potential clinical applications.},

Microbes seem to use strategies ranging from a pure sizer, where the end of a given phase is triggered when the cell reaches a critical size, to pure adder, where the cell adds a constant size during a phase. Yet the biological origins of the observed spectrum of behavior remain elusive. We analyze a molecular size-control mechanism, based on experimental data from the yeast S. cerevisiae, that gives rise to behaviors smoothly interpolating between adder and sizer. The size-control is obtained from the accumulation of an activator protein that titrates an inhibitor protein. Strikingly, the size-control is composed of two different regimes: for small initial cell size, the size-control is a sizer, whereas for larger initial cell size, it is an imperfect adder, in agreement with recent experiments. Our model thus indicates that the adder and critical size behaviors may just be different dynamical regimes of a single simple biophysical mechanism.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cell size and growth kinetics are fundamental cellular properties with important physiological implications. Classical studies on yeast, and recently on bacteria, have identified rules for cell size regulation in single cells, but in the more complex environment of multicellular tissues, data have been lacking. In this study, to characterize cell size and growth regulation in a multicellular context, we developed a 4D imaging pipeline and applied it to track and quantify epidermal cells over 3–4 d in \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} shoot apical meristems. We found that a cell size checkpoint is not the trigger for G2/M or cytokinesis, refuting the unexamined assumption that meristematic cells trigger cell cycle phases upon reaching a critical size. Our data also rule out models in which cells undergo G2/M at a fixed time after birth, or by adding a critical size increment between G2/M transitions. Rather, cell size regulation was intermediate between the critical size and critical increment paradigms, meaning that cell size fluctuations decay by ∼75\% in one generation compared with 100\% (critical size) and 50\% (critical increment). Notably, this behavior was independent of local cell–cell contact topologies and of position within the tissue. Cells grew exponentially throughout the first \&gt;80\% of the cell cycle, but following an asymmetrical division, the small daughter grew at a faster exponential rate than the large daughter, an observation that potentially challenges present models of growth regulation. These growth and division behaviors place strong constraints on quantitative mechanistic descriptions of the cell cycle and growth control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, proteome-wide technologies to investigate the causes and consequences of protein degradation in biological systems are lacking. We developed "multiplexed proteome dynamics profiling" (mPDP), a mass-spectrometry-based approach combining dynamic-SILAC labeling with isobaric mass tagging for multiplexed analysis of protein degradation and synthesis. In three proof-of-concept studies, we uncover different responses induced by the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 versus a JQ1 proteolysis targeting chimera; we elucidate distinct modes of action of estrogen receptor modulators; and we comprehensively classify HSP90 clients based on their requirement for HSP90 constitutively or during synthesis, demonstrating that constitutive HSP90 clients have lower thermal stability than non-clients, have higher affinity for the chaperone, vary between cell types, and change upon external stimuli. These findings highlight the potential of mPDP to identify dynamically controlled degradation mechanisms in cellular systems.},

	abstract = {CDC37, an essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, interacts genetically with multiple protein kinases and is required for production of Cdc28p/cyclin complexes through an unknown mechanism. We have identified mammalian p50(Cdc37) as a protein kinase-targeting subunit of the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Previously, p50 was observed in complexes with pp60(v-src) and Raf-1, but its identity and function have remained elusive. In mouse fibroblasts, a primary target of Cdc37 is Cdk4. This kinase is activated by D-type cyclins and functions in passage through G1. In insect cells, Cdc37 is sufficient to target Hsp90 to Cdk4 and both in vitro and in vivo, Cdc37/Hsp90 associates preferentially with the fraction of Cdk4 not bound to D-type cyclins. Cdc37 is coexpressed with cyclin D1 in cells undergoing programmed proliferation in vivo, consistent with a positive role in cell cycle progression. Pharmacological inactivation of Cdc37/Hsp90 function decreases the half-life of newly synthesized Cdk4, indicating a role for Cdc37/Hsp90 in Cdk4 stabilization. This study suggests a general role for p50(Cdc37) in signaling pathways dependent on intrinsically unstable protein kinases and reveals a previously unrecognized chaperone-dependent step in the production of Cdk4/cyclin D complexes.},

Here, we combine transcriptomics with proteomics to define a definitive molecular signature for Lgr5 + CBC cells. Transcriptional profiling of FACS-sorted Lgr5 + stem cells and their daughters using two microarray platforms revealed an mRNA stem cell signature of 384 unique genes. Quantitative mass spectrometry on the same cell populations identified 278 proteins enriched in intestinal stem cells. The mRNA and protein data sets showed a high level of correlation and a combined signature of 510 stem cell-enriched genes was defined. Spatial expression patterns were further characterized by mRNA in-situ hybridization, revealing that approximately half of the genes were expressed in a gradient with highest levels at the crypt bottom, while the other half was expressed uniquely in Lgr5 + stem cells. Lineage tracing using a newly established knock-in mouse for one of the signature genes, Smoc2, confirmed its stem cell specificity. Using this resource, we find-and confirm by independent approaches-that the proposed quiescent/′ +4′ stem cell markers Bmi1, Tert, Hopx and Lrig1 are robustly expressed in CBC cells. © 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization {\textbar} All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Proper cell size is essential for cellular function. Nonetheless, despite more than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell-size homeostasis are largely mysterious [1]. Cells in growing populations maintain cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains population-level variation in cell size within a certain range and returns the population average to that range if it is perturbed [1, 2]. Recent work has proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S transition [3], whereas bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable average [4-6]. Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size-dependent expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. cdc25 transcript levels are regulated such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25, creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cells grow and providing a mechanism for cells to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold concentration of Cdc25. Because regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well conserved, this mechanism may provide a widespread solution to the problem of size control in eukaryotes.},

Here we identify clonal human breast cancer subpopulations that display different levels of morphological and molecular diversity. Highly variable subpopulations are more proficient at metastatic colonization and chemotherapeutic survival. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, inter-cell transcript expression variability is identified as a defining feature of the highly variable subpopulations that leads to protein-level variation. Furthermore, we identify high variability in the spliceosomal machinery gene set. Engineered variable expression of the spliceosomal gene SNRNP40 promotes metastasis, attributable to cells with low expression. Clinically, low SNRNP40 expression is associated with metastatic relapse. Our findings reveal transcriptomic variability generation as a mechanism by which cancer subpopulations can diversify gene expression states, which may allow for enhanced fitness under changing environmental pressures encountered during cancer progression.},

The mechanisms that generate these distinct patterns of progeny are poorly understood. Using light sheet and confocal imaging of intestinal organoids, we show that lineages intersperse during cytokinesis, when elongated interphase cells insert between apically displaced daughters. Reducing the cellular aspect ratio to minimize the height difference between interphase and mitotic cells disrupts interspersion, producing contiguous patches. Cellular aspect ratio is similarly a key parameter for division-coupled interspersion in the early mouse embryo, suggesting that this physical mechanism for patterning progeny may pertain to many mammalian epithelia. Our results reveal that the process of cytokinesis in elongated mammalian epithelia allows lineages to intermix and that cellular aspect ratio is a critical modulator of the progeny pattern.},

Here, we show that, in contrast, deletion of the entire Rb gene family in mature hepatocytes is not sufficient for their long-term proliferation. The cell cycle block in Rb family mutant hepatocytes is independent of the Arf/p53/p21 checkpoint but can be abrogated upon decreasing liver size. At the molecular level, we identify YAP, a transcriptional regulator involved in organ size control, as a factor required for the sustained expression of cell cycle genes in hepatocytes.

We further show that this increase in volume is tightly linked to the mitotic state of the cell and not to its spread or rounded shape and is independent of the presence of an intact actomyosin cortex. Importantly, this volume increase is not accompanied by an increase in dry mass and thus corresponds to a decrease in cell density. This mitotic swelling might have important consequences for mitotic progression: it might contribute to produce strong pushing forces, allowing mitotic cells to round up; it might also, by lowering cytoplasmic density, contribute to the large change of physicochemical properties observed in mitotic cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Canonically, Gα is stimulated by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of ligand-bound G protein-coupled receptors. However, Gα subunits may also be activated in a noncanonical manner by members of the Ric-8 family, cytoplasmic proteins that also act as GEFs for Gα subunits. We used a signaling pathway active during Drosophila gastrulation as a model system to study Ric-8/Gα interactions. A component of this pathway, the Drosophila Gα12/13 subunit, Concertina (Cta), is necessary to trigger actomyosin contractility during gastrulation events. Ric-8 mutants exhibit similar gastrulation defects to Cta mutants. Here we use a novel tissue culture system to study a signaling pathway that controls cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for cellular morphogenesis. We show that Ric-8 regulates this pathway through physical interaction with Cta and preferentially interacts with inactive Cta and directs its localization within the cell. We also use this system to conduct a structure-function analysis of Ric-8 and identify key residues required for both Cta interaction and cellular contractility.},

The oncogene-driven cells proliferated 1.7 times faster and showed a 1.5-fold increase in cell volume. The two phenotypes could be converted into each other 24 h after altering growth factor signalling. The large cells had a higher rate of protein synthesis, together with a shortened G1 phase. Additional experiments with chicken erythroblasts and mouse fibroblasts, synchronized by centrifugal elutriation, provided further evidence that vertebrate cells can respond to cell size alterations (induced either through different growth factor signalling or DNA synthesis inhibitors) by compensatory shortening of the subsequent G1 phase. Taken together, these data suggest that an active size threshold mechanism exists in G1, which induces adjustment of cell-cycle length in the next cycle, thus ensuring maintenance of a proper balance between growth and proliferation rates in vertebrates.},

We also show that the secreted signal Wingless patterns growth in the wing primordium by modulating dMyc expression. Our results indicate that dMyc links patterning signals to cell division by regulating primary targets involved in cellular growth and metabolism.},

	abstract = {Cell size homeostasis is often achieved by coupling cell-cycle progression to cell growth. Growth has been shown to drive cell-cycle progression in bacteria and yeast through "sizers," wherein cells of varying birth size divide at similar final sizes [1-3], and "adders," wherein cells increase in size a fixed amount per cell cycle [4-6]. Intermediate control phenomena are also observed, and even the same organism can exhibit different control phenomena depending on growth conditions [2, 7, 8]. Although studying unicellular organisms in laboratory conditions may give insight into their growth control in the wild, this is less apparent for studies of mammalian cells growing outside the organism. Sizers, adders, and intermediate phenomena have been observed in vitro [9-12], but it is unclear how this relates to mammalian cell proliferation in vivo. To address this question, we analyzed time-lapse images of the mouse epidermis taken over 1 week during normal tissue turnover [13]. We quantified the 3D volume growth and cell-cycle progression of single cells within the mouse skin. In dividing epidermal stem cells, we found that cell growth is coupled to division through a sizer operating largely in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, although the majority of tissue culture studies have identified adders, our analysis demonstrates that sizers are important in vivo and highlights the need to determine their underlying molecular origin.},

Several unexpected compensatory mechanisms were uncovered among cyclins and Cdks in these studies. The most astonishing observation is that Cdk2 is dispensable for the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle with both Cdk4 and Cdk1 covering for Cdk2's functions. Similar to yeast, it was recently discovered that Cdk1 alone can drive the mammalian cell cycle, indicating that the regulation of the mammalian cell cycle is highly conserved. Nevertheless, cell-cycle-independent functions of Cdks and cyclins such as in DNA damage repair are still under investigation.

In both homeostasis and upon experimental perturbation, we find that differentiation of a single stem cell is followed by division of a direct neighbor, but not vice versa. Finally, we show that exit from the stem cell compartment is sufficient to drive neighboring stem cell self-renewal. Together, these findings establish that epidermal stem cell self-renewal is not the constitutive driver of homeostasis. Instead, it is precisely tuned to tissue demand and responds directly to neighbor cell differentiation.},

We further demonstrate that mG labeling is Cre-dependent, complementary to mT at single cell resolution, and distinguishable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both membrane-targeted markers outline cell morphology, highlight membrane structures, and permit visualization of fine cellular processes.

	abstract = {Morphogenesis involves the interplay of different cytoskeletal regulators. Investigating how they interact during a given morphogenetic event will help us understand animal development. Studies of ventral furrow formation, a morphogenetic event during Drosophila gastrulation, have identified a signaling pathway involving the G-protein Concertina (Cta) and the Rho activator RhoGEF2. Although these regulators act to promote stable myosin accumulation and apical cell constriction, loss-of-function phenotypes for each of these pathway members is not equivalent, suggesting the existence of additional ventral furrow regulators. Here, we report the identification of Abelson kinase (Abl) as a novel ventral furrow regulator. We find that Abl acts apically to suppress the accumulation of both Enabled (Ena) and actin in mesodermal cells during ventral furrow formation. Further, RhoGEF2 also regulates ordered actin localization during ventral furrow formation, whereas its activator, Cta, does not. Taken together, our data suggest that there are two crucial preconditions for apical constriction in the ventral furrow: myosin stabilization/activation, regulated by Cta and RhoGEF2; and the organization of apical actin, regulated by Abl and RhoGEF2. These observations identify an important morphogenetic role for Abl and suggest a conserved mechanism for this kinase during apical cell constriction.},

	abstract = {Most cells in mammalian tissues usually contain a diploid complement of chromosomes. However, numerous studies have demonstrated a major role of "diploid-polyploid conversion" during physiopathological processes in several tissues. In the liver parenchyma, progressive polyploidization of hepatocytes takes place during postnatal growth. Indeed, at the suckling-weaning transition, cytokinesis failure events induce the genesis of binucleated tetraploid liver cells. Insulin signalling, through regulation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, is essential in the establishment of liver tetraploidization by controlling cytoskeletal organisation and consequently mitosis progression. Liver cell polyploidy is generally considered to indicate terminal differentiation and senescence, and both lead to a progressive loss of cell pluripotency associated to a markedly decreased replication capacity. Although adult liver is a quiescent organ, it retains a capacity to proliferate and to modulate its ploidy in response to various stimuli or aggression (partial hepatectomy, metabolic overload (i.e., high copper and iron hepatic levels), oxidative stress, toxic insult, and chronic hepatitis etc.). Here we review the mechanisms and functional consequences of hepatocytes polyploidization during normal and pathological liver growth.},

To expand this toolset, we have developed a screening strategy for the direct engineering of self-complementing split FPs. Via this strategy, we have generated a yellow–green split-mNeonGreen21–10/11 that improves the ratio of complemented signal to the background of FP1–10-expressing cells compared to the commonly used split GFP1–10/11; as well as a 10-fold brighter red-colored split-sfCherry21–10/11. Based on split sfCherry2, we have engineered a photoactivatable variant that enables single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. We have demonstrated dual-color endogenous protein tagging with sfCherry211 and GFP11, revealing that endoplasmic reticulum translocon complex Sec61B has reduced abundance in certain peripheral tubules. These new split FPs not only offer multiple colors for imaging interaction networks of endogenous proteins, but also hold the potential to provide orthogonal handles for biochemical isolation of native protein complexes. Split fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been widely used to visualise proteins in cells.

	abstract = {How robust patterns of tissue dynamics emerge from heterogeneities, stochasticities, and asynchronies in cell behavior is an outstanding question in morphogenesis. A clear understanding of this requires examining the influence of the behavior of single cells on tissue patterning. Here we develop single-cell manipulation strategies to uncover the origin of patterned cell behavior in the amnioserosa during Drosophila dorsal closure. We show that the formation and dissolution of contractile, medial actomyosin networks previously shown to underlie pulsed apical constrictions in the amnioserosa are apparently asynchronous in adjacent cells. We demonstrate for the first time that mechanical stresses and Rho1 GTPase control myosin dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively, in amplitude and direction, both cell autonomously and nonautonomously. We then demonstrate that interfering with myosin-dependent contractility in single cells also influences pulsed constrictions cell nonautonomously. Our results suggest that signals and stresses can feedback regulate the amplitude and spatial propagation of pulsed constrictions through their influence on tension and geometry. We establish the relevance of these findings to native closure by showing that cell delamination represents a locally patterned and collective transition from pulsed to unpulsed constriction that also relies on the nonautonomous feedback control of myosin dynamics. © 2013 Saravanan et al.},

	abstract = {Organelles serve as biochemical reactors in the cell, and often display characteristic scaling trends with cell size, suggesting mechanisms that coordinate their sizes. In this study, we measure the vacuole-cell size scaling trends in budding yeast using optical microscopy and a novel, to our knowledge, image analysis algorithm. Vacuole volume and surface area both show characteristic scaling trends with respect to cell size that are consistent among different strains. Rapamycin treatment was found to increase vacuole-cell size scaling trends for both volume and surface area. Unexpectedly, these increases did not depend on macroautophagy, as similar increases in vacuole size were observed in the autophagy deficient mutants atg1Δ and atg5Δ. Rather, rapamycin appears to act on vacuole size by inhibiting retrograde membrane trafficking, as the atg18Δ mutant, which is defective in retrograde trafficking, shows similar vacuole size scaling to rapamycin-treated cells and is itself insensitive to rapamycin treatment. Disruption of anterograde membrane trafficking in the apl5Δ mutant leads to complementary changes in vacuole size scaling. These quantitative results lead to a simple model for vacuole size scaling based on proportionality between cell growth rates and vacuole growth rates.},

DRhoGEF2 function is essential for the coordination of cell shape changes during gastrulation. In the absence of maternal DRhoGEF2 gene activity, mesodermal and endodermal primordia fail to invaginate. The phenotype seen in DRhoGEF2 mutants is more severe than the defects associated with mutations in two previously identified gastrulation genes, folded gastrulation and concertina, suggesting that DRhoGEF2 acts in a signaling pathway independent of these genes. Expression of dominant-negative DRhoA during gastrulation results in phenocopies of the DRhoGEF2 mutant, suggesting that a signaling cascade involving DRhoGEF2 and the small GTPase DRhoA is responsible for the regulation of cell shape changes during early Drosophila morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Compensatory liver hyperplasia-or regeneration-induced by two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) permits the study of synchronized activation of mammalian gene expression, particularly in relation to cell proliferation. Here, we measured genomic transcriptional responses and mRNA accumulation changes after PH and sham surgeries. RESULTS:During the first 10-20 h, the PH- and sham-surgery responses were very similar, including parallel early activation of cell-division-cycle genes. After 20 h, however, whereas post-PH livers continued with a robust and coordinate cell-division-cycle gene-expression response before returning to the resting state by 1 week, sham-surgery livers returned directly to a resting gene-expression state. Localization of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and 36 (H3K36me3) on genes dormant in the resting liver and activated during the PH response revealed a general de novo promoter Pol II recruitment and H3K4me3 increase during the early 10-20 h phase followed by Pol II elongation and H3K36me3 accumulation in gene bodies during the later proliferation phase. H3K36me3, generally appearing at the first internal exon, was preceded 5' by H3K36me2; 3' of the first internal exon, in about half of genes H3K36me3 predominated and in the other half H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 co-existed. Further, we observed some unusual gene profiles with abundant Pol II but little evident H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 modification, indicating that these modifications are neither universal nor essential partners to Pol II transcription. CONCLUSIONS:PH and sham surgical procedures on mice reveal striking early post-operatory gene expression similarities followed by synchronized mRNA accumulation and epigenetic histone mark changes specific to PH.},

We identified a Twist target, the transmembrane protein T48, which acts in conjunction with G protein signaling to orchestrate shape changes. Together with G protein signaling, T48 recruits adherens junctions and the cytoskeletal regulator RhoGEF2 to the sites of apical constriction, ensuring rapid and intense changes in cell shape.},

	abstract = {Stem cell quiescence has been hypothesized to suppress the rate at which genetic mutations accumulate within tissues by reducing the number of divisions a cell undergoes. However, recent studies have suggested that stem cells in the small intestine are rapidly dividing. This observation raises the issue of whether replication related errors are an important contributor to the accumulation of genetic damage and, if so, how genomic integrity is maintained within the small intestine. Here, reporter-marked small intestinal epithelial cells, resulting from mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2 (Mcm2) gene driven Cre-mediated recombination, are shown to be retained at the +1 position within the crypt and to contribute to the intestinal epithelia over long periods. Additionally, we show that the rate of cycling of +1 position Mcm2-expressing stem cells is heterogeneous with cycling times ranging between 1 and 4 days. Further, this heterogeneity depends on the p53 signaling pathway and could provide the basis for retention and expansion, through niche succession and crypt fission, of genetically intact stem cells. This somatic selection process would require active cellular replication. © AlphaMed Press.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor gene occur in most human colon cancers. Loss of functional APC protein results in the accumulation of β-catenin. Mutant forms of β-catenin have been discovered in colon cancers that retain wild-type APC genes, and also in melanomas, medulloblastomas, prostate cancer and gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas. The accumulation of β-catenin activates genes that are responsive to transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, with which β- catenin interacts. Here we show that β-catenin activates transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, and that sequences within the promoter that are related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites are necessary for activation. The oncoprotein p21(ras) further activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, through sites within the promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators Ets or CREB. Cells expressing mutant β-catenin produce high levels of cyclin D1 messenger RNA and protein constitutively. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of TCF in colon-cancer cells strongly inhibits expression of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of cyclin D2, cyclin E, or cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4 or 6. This dominant- negative TCF causes cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; this phenotype can be rescued by expression of cyclin D1 under the cytomegalovirus promoter. Abnormal levels of β-catenin may therefore contribute to neoplastic transformation by causing accumulation of cyclin D1.},

The two tags, GFP11 and sfCherry11 are derived from the eleventh β-strand of super-folder GFP and sfCherry, respectively. The small size of FP11-tags enables a cost-effective and scalable way to insert them into endogenous genomic loci via CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair. Tandem arrangement FP11-tags allows proportional enhancement of fluorescence signal in tracking intraflagellar transport particles, or reduction of photobleaching for live microtubule imaging. Finally, we show the utility of tandem GFP11-tag in scaffolding protein oligomerization. These experiments illustrate the versatility of FP11-tag as a labelling tool as well as a multimerization-control tool for both imaging and non-imaging applications.},

	abstract = {In the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cln3–cyclin-dependent kinase activity enables Start, the irreversible commitment to the cell division cycle. However, the concentration of Cln3 has been paradoxically considered to remain constant during G1, due to the presumed scaling of its production rate with cell size dynamics. Measuring metabolic and biosynthetic activity during cell cycle progression in single cells, we found that cells exhibit pulses in their protein production rate. Rather than scaling with cell size dynamics, these pulses follow the intrinsic metabolic dynamics, peaking around Start. Using a viral-based bicistronic construct and targeted proteomics to measure Cln3 at the single-cell and population levels, we show that the differential scaling between protein production and cell size leads to a temporal increase in Cln3 concentration, and passage through Start. This differential scaling causes Start in both daughter and mother cells across growth conditions. Thus, uncoupling between two fundamental physiological parameters drives cell cycle commitment. By measuring metabolic and biosynthetic activity with cell cycle progression, Litsios et el. uncover pulses in protein production rate that do not scale with cell size but drive cell cycle entry in budding yeast.},

Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of Elk-1 by the protein kinase ERK at multiple sites potentiates recruitment of the Mediator transcriptional coactivator complex and transcriptional activation, but the roles of individual phosphorylation events had remained unclear. Using time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that ERK2 phosphorylation proceeds at markedly different rates at eight TAD sites in vitro, which we classified as fast, intermediate, and slow. Mutagenesis experiments showed that phosphorylation of fast and intermediate sites promoted Mediator interaction and transcriptional activation, whereas modification of slow sites counteracted both functions, thereby limiting Elk-1 output. Progressive Elk-1 phosphorylation thus ensures a self-limiting response to ERK activation, which occurs independently of antagonizing phosphatase activity.},

	abstract = {We discuss the physical aspects of the morphogenic process of convergence (narrowing) and extension (lengthening) of tissues by cell intercalation. These movements, often referred to as 'convergent extension', occur in both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues during embryogenesis and organogenesis of invertebrates and vertebrates, and they play large roles in shaping the body plan during development. Our focus is on the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues of the Xenopus (frog) embryo, tissues for which some physical measurements have been made. We discuss the physical aspects of how polarized cell motility, oriented along future tissue axes, generate the forces that drive oriented cell intercalation and how this intercalation results in convergence and extension or convergence and thickening of the tissue. Our goal is to identify aspects of these morphogenic movements for further biophysical, molecular and cell biological, and modeling studies. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {A remarkable feature of regenerative processes is their ability to halt proliferation once an organ's structure has been restored. The Wnt signalling pathway is the major driving force for homeostatic self-renewal and regeneration in the mammalian intestine. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance Wnt-driven proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in mice and humans that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP; also known as YAP1)-a protein known for its powerful growth-inducing and oncogenic properties-has an unexpected growth-suppressive function, restricting Wnt signals during intestinal regeneration. Transgenic expression of YAP reduces Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid loss of intestinal crypts. In addition, loss of YAP results in Wnt hypersensitivity during regeneration, leading to hyperplasia, expansion of intestinal stem cells and niche cells, and formation of ectopic crypts and microadenomas. We find that cytoplasmic YAP restricts elevated Wnt signalling independently of the AXIN-APC-GSK-3β complex partly by limiting the activity of dishevelled (DVL). DVL signals in the nucleus of intestinal stem cells, and its forced expression leads to enhanced Wnt signalling in crypts. YAP dampens Wnt signals by restricting DVL nuclear translocation during regenerative growth. Finally, we provide evidence that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas, and that its expression can restrict the growth of colorectal carcinoma xenografts. Collectively, our work describes a novel mechanistic paradigm for how proliferative signals are counterbalanced in regenerating tissues. Additionally, our findings have important implications for the targeting of YAP in human malignancies. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

This study examined the HMGB1 status of both highly and poorly metastatic cancer cells in response to genotoxic stress. The weakly and highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell lines (B16 vs. B16-F10), human melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-28 vs. SK-MEL-24), colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 vs. LS174T), and wild-type (WT) vs. HMGB1 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with doxorubicin (Dox) and camptothecin (CPT), and then cellular morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, lactate dehydrogenase release, and caspase-3 activation were used to assess cell fate. To investigate the role of HMGB1 in p21 expression, HMGB1 and p21 expressions were examined by Western blotting, and the HMGB1-mediated p21 promoter luciferase assay was performed after small interfering RNA or overexpression of HMGB1 prior to Dox treatment. Although highly metastatic mouse melanoma B16-F10 cells preferred senescence, with persistent HMGB1 expression, poorly metastatic B16 cells entered apoptosis, with decreasing HMGB1 levels via cleavage under Dox treatment. Similarly, more metastatic human melanoma SK-MEL-24 and human colon cancer LS174T cells underwent senescence, whereas fewer metastatic melanoma SK-MEL-28 and DLD-1 cells exhibited apoptosis under Dox stimulation. In senescent B16-F10, SK-MEL-24, and LS174T cells treated with Dox, p21 levels were increased by persistent HMGB1 expression. Furthermore, HMGB1 depletion caused a senescence-apoptosis shift with p21 down-regulation in B16-F10 cells, and HMGB1 overexpression switched from apoptosis to senescence concomitantly with increased p21 expression in B16 cells after Dox treatment. The same effects were observed in both cell pairs of mouse melanoma and human colon cancer cells treated with CPT, another genotoxic stressor. Indeed, although WT MEF entered senescence accompanied by p21 increase, HMGB1 KO underwent apoptosis with p21 decrease by Dox treatment. In our cell model system, we demonstrated that highly metastatic cancer cells preferentially enter senescence, whereas apoptosis predominates in weakly metastatic cancer cells under genotoxic stress, which depends on the presence or absence of HMGB1, suggesting that the HMGB1-p21 axis is required for genotoxic stress-induced senescence. These findings suggest that HMGB1 modulation of cancers with different metastatic status could be a strategy for selectively enforcing tumor suppression.-Lee, J.-J., Park, I. H., Rhee, W. J., Kim, H.

	abstract = {The G protein β5 subunit differs from other β subunits in having divergent sequence and subcellular localization patterns. Although β5γ2 modulates effectors, β5 associates with R7 family regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins when purified from tissues. To investigate β5 complex formation in vivo, we used multicolor bimolecular fluorescence complementation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to compare the abilities of 7 γ subunits and RGS7 to compete for interaction with β5. Among the γ subunits, β5 interacted preferentially with γ2, followed by γ7, and efficacy of phospholipase C-β2 activation correlated with amount of β5γ complex formation. β5 also slightly preferred γ2 over RGS7. In the presence of coexpressed R7 family binding protein (R7BP), β5 interacted similarly with γ2 and RGS7. Moreover, γ2 interacted preferentially with β1 rather than β5. These results suggest that multiple coexpressed proteins influence β5 complex formation. Fluorescent β5γ2 labeled discrete intracellular structures including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, whereas β5RGS7 stained the cytoplasm diffusely. Coexpression of αo targeted both β5 complexes to the plasma membrane, and αq also targeted β5γ 2 to the plasma membrane. The constitutively activated αo mutant, αoR179C, produced greater targeting of β5RGS7 and less of β5γ2 than did αo. These results suggest that αo may cycle between interactions with β5γ2 or other βγ complexes when inactive, and β5RGS7 when active. Moreover, the ability of β5γ2 to be targeted to the plasma membrane by α subunits suggests that functional β5γ2 complexes can form in intact cells and mediate signaling by G protein-coupled receptors.

	abstract = {There is a gradient of β-catenin expression along the colonic crypt axis with the highest levels at the crypt bottom. In addition, colorectal cancers show a heterogeneous subcellular pattern of β-catenin accumulation. However, it remains unclear whether different levels of Wnt signalling exert distinct roles in the colonic epithelium. Here, we investigated the dose-dependent effect of canonical Wnt activation on colonic epithelial differentiation by controlling the expression levels of stabilised β-catenin using a doxycyclineinducible transgenic system in mice. We show that elevated levels of Wnt signalling induce the amplification of Lgr5+ cells, which is accompanied by crypt fission and a reduction in cell proliferation among progenitor cells. By contrast, lower levels of β-catenin induction enhance cell proliferation rates of epithelial progenitors without affecting crypt fission rates. Notably, slow-cycling cells produced by β-catenin activation exhibit activation of Notch signalling. Consistent with the interpretation that the combination of Notch and Wnt signalling maintains crypt cells in a low proliferative state, the treatment of β-catenin-expressing mice with a Notch inhibitor turned such slow-cycling cells into actively proliferating cells. Our results indicate that the activation of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway is sufficient for de novo crypt formation, and suggest that different levels of canonical Wnt activations, in cooperation with Notch signalling, establish a hierarchy of slower-cycling stem cells and faster-cycling progenitor cells characteristic for the colonic epithelium. © 2013.

Abrupt activation follows a lag period, the length of which is independent of the concentration of cyclin. The threshold concentration of cyclin and the length of the lag period are regulated by INH, an inhibitor of MPF activation in oocytes recently identified as a type 2A protein phosphatase. Binding to cyclin induces both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of the previously unphosphorylated p34cdc2, rendering it inactivated. The concerted transition into mitosis involves both a reduction in the rate of p34cdc2 phosphorylation on tyrosine and an increase in its rate of dephosphorylation. © 1990.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Translation efficiency is affected by a diversity of parameters, including secondary structure of the transcript and its codon usage. Here we examine the effects of codon usage on translation efficiency by re-analysis of previously constructed synthetic expression libraries in Escherichia coli. RESULTS:We define the region in a gene that takes the longest time to translate as the bottleneck. We found that localization of the bottleneck at the beginning of a transcript promoted a high level of expression, especially if the computed dwell time of the ribosome within this region was sufficiently long. The location and translation time of the bottleneck were not correlated with the cost of expression, approximated by the fitness of the host cell, yet utilization of specific codons was. Particularly, enhanced usage of the codons UCA and CAU was correlated with increased cost of production, potentially due to sequestration of their corresponding rare tRNAs. CONCLUSIONS:The distribution of codons along the genes appears to affect translation efficiency, consistent with analysis of natural genes. This study demonstrates how synthetic biology complements bioinformatics by providing a set-up for well controlled experiments in biology.},

	abstract = {CDK1 is a nonredundant cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) with an essential role in mitosis, but its multiple functions still are poorly understood at a molecular level. Here we identify a selective small-molecule inhibitor of CDK1 that reversibly arrests human cells at the G(2)/M border of the cell cycle and allows for effective cell synchronization in early mitosis. Inhibition of CDK1 during cell division revealed that its activity is necessary and sufficient for maintaining the mitotic state of the cells, preventing replication origin licensing and premature cytokinesis. Although CDK1 inhibition for up to 24 h is well tolerated, longer exposure to the inhibitor induces apoptosis in tumor cells, suggesting that selective CDK1 inhibitors may have utility in cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) can effectively resolve chromosome breaks despite diverse end structures; however, it is unclear how the steps employed for resolution are determined. We sought to address this question by analysing cellular NHEJ of ends with systematically mispaired and damaged termini. We show NHEJ is uniquely proficient at bypassing subtle terminal mispairs and radiomimetic damage by direct ligation. Nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6\%. End-processing by nucleases and polymerases is increased to compensate, although paths with the fewest number of steps to generate a substrate suitable for ligation are favoured. Thus, both the frequency and nature of end processing are tailored to meet the needs of the ligation step. We propose a model where the ligase organizes all steps during NHEJ within the stable paired-end complex to limit end processing and associated errors.},

At physiological ionic strength and pH, nonphosphorylated smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin filaments are disassembled by stoichiometric levels of MgATP, forming species having sedimentation coefficients of approximately 11S (range 10-12S; myosin monomers in high salt sediment at 6S). When the 20,000 (20K)-Mr light chains on these 11S myosin species are phosphorylated by the light-chain kinase/calmodulin-Ca2+ complex, the inhibitory effect of the light chains on filament formation is removed and the myosins reassemble into filaments which are stable in MgATP. It was originally suggested that the 11S myosin species was a dimer, previously suggested as a building block for smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin filaments. It has since been shown, however, that 11S smooth muscle myosin is monomeric and has a folded conformation rather than the extended shape characteristic of monomeric myosin in high salt. Here we show that 11S non-muscle myosin is also folded and that phosphorylation of the 20K-Mr light chains of both vertebrate non-muscle (thymus) and vertebrate smooth muscle (gizzard) myosins causes these folded 11S molecules to unfold into the conventional extended monomeric form, which is able to assemble into filaments.},

	abstract = {The size and metabolic rate of cells affect processes from the molecular to the organismal level. We present a quantitative, theoretical framework for studying relationships among cell volume, cellular metabolic rate, body size, and whole-organism metabolic rate that helps reveal the feedback between these levels of organization. We use this framework to show that average cell volume and average cellular metabolic rate cannot both remain constant with changes in body size because of the well known body-size dependence of whole-organism metabolic rate. Based on empirical data compiled for 18 cell types in mammals, we find that many cell types, including erythrocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, follow a strategy in which cellular metabolic rate is body size dependent and cell volume is body size invariant. We suggest that this scaling holds for all quickly dividing cells, and conversely, that slowly dividing cells are expected to follow a strategy in which cell volume is body size dependent and cellular metabolic rate is roughly invariant with body size. Data for slowly dividing neurons and adipocytes show that cell volume does indeed scale with body size. From these results, we argue that the particular strategy followed depends on the structural and functional properties of the cell type. We also discuss consequences of these two strategies for cell number and capillary densities. Our results and conceptual framework emphasize fundamental constraints that link the structure and function of cells to that of whole organisms.},

	abstract = {Inactivation of the Apc gene is recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), where its loss leads to constitutive activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor 4 signaling and hence transcription of Wnt target genes such as c-Myc. Our and other previous studies have shown that although cyclin D1 is required for adenoma formation, it is not immediately upregulated following Apc loss within the intestine, suggesting that proliferation following acute Apc loss may be dependent on another D-type cyclin. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional relevance of cyclin D2 following Apc loss in the intestinal epithelium. Cyclin D2 is upregulated immediately following Apc loss, which corresponded with a significant increase in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and hyperphosphorylated Rb levels. Deficiency of cyclin D2 resulted in a reduction in enterocyte proliferation and crypt size within Apc-deficient intestinal epithelium. Moreover, cyclin D2 dramatically reduced tumor growth and development in ApcMin/+ mice. Importantly, cyclin D2 knockout did not affect proliferation of normal enterocytes, and furthermore, CDK4/6 inhibition also suppressed the proliferation of adenomatous cells and not normal cells from ApcMin/+ mice. Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin D - CDK4/6 complexes are required for the efficient proliferation of cells with deregulated Wnt signaling, and inhibiting this complex may be an effective chemopreventative strategy in CRC. ©2010 AACR.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Inc. At the restriction point (R), mammalian cells irreversibly commit to divide. R has been viewed as a point in G1 that is passed when growth factor signaling initiates a positive feedback loop of Cdk activity. However, recent studies have cast doubt on this model by claiming R occurs prior to positive feedback activation in G1 or even before completion of the previous cell cycle. Here we reconcile these results and show that whereas many commonly used cell lines do not exhibit a G1 R, primary fibroblasts have a G1 R that is defined by a precise Cdk activity threshold and the activation of cell-cycle-dependent transcription. A simple threshold model, based solely on Cdk activity, predicted with more than 95\% accuracy whether individual cells had passed R. That a single measurement accurately predicted cell fate shows that the state of complex regulatory networks can be assessed using a few critical protein activities. Schwarz et al. examine the responses of primary cells expressing a live-cell Cdk activity sensor to growth factor removal. They find that Cdk activity at the time of growth factor removal is an accurate predictor of whether a cell subsequently divides.},

The subcellular localization and activity of TFEB are regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated phosphorylation, which occurs at the lysosomal surface. Phosphorylated TFEB is retained in the cytoplasm, whereas dephosphorylated TFEB translocates to the nucleus to induce the transcription of target genes. Thus, a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathway regulates cellular energy metabolism through TFEB. Recently, in vivo studies have revealed that TFEB is also involved in physiological processes, such as lipid catabolism. TFEB has attracted a lot of attention owing to its ability to induce the intracellular clearance of pathogenic factors in a variety of murine models of disease, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, suggesting that novel therapeutic strategies could be based on the modulation of TFEB activity.

          The number of cells in tissues is tightly controlled by cell division and cell death, and misregulation of cell numbers could lead to pathological conditions such as cancer. To maintain cell numbers in a tissue, a cell elimination process named programmed cell death or apoptosis, stimulates the proliferation of neighboring cells. This mechanism is called apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation, which was originally reported more than 40 years ago. While only a limited number of the neigboring cells need to divide to compensate for apoptotic cell loss, the mechanisms that select cells for undergoing division remain an open question. Here we found that the spatial inhomogeneity in mechanotransduction through a growth-promoting transcription co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the neighboring tissue, accounts for the inhomogeneity of compensatory proliferation. Such inhomogeneous mechanotransduction arises from the combination of the non-uniform distribution of nuclear size, which is inherent in tissues, and the non-uniform pattern of mechanical force applied to the neighboring cells upon apoptosis. Our findings from a mechanical perspective complement the current biochemical understanding of compensatory growth and provide additional insights into cellular functions of how tissue precisely maintains its homeostasis.},

This mechanism is dependent on effector caspases which trigger the activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling for compensatory proliferation. Furthermore, whereas Dpp and Wg signaling is preferentially employed in apoptotic proliferating tissues, Hh signaling is activated in differentiating eye tissues. Interestingly, effector caspases in photoreceptor neurons stimulate Hh signaling which triggers cell-cycle reentry of cells that had previously exited the cell cycle.

Efforts continue to uncover the long-sought mechanism by which cells coordinate growth and cell division to maintain a constant size. Zatulovskiy et al. propose that human cells sense the concentration of the retinoblastoma family protein Rb. Rb itself acts on transcription factors to inhibit progression through the cell cycle. As cells grow, the concentration of Rb decreases by dilution, and the cell can then divide. In mice heterozygous or homozygous for an Rb gene deletion, the size of liver hepatocytes decreased—and variability in cell size increased—as each Rb allele was lost.
Science, this issue p. 466
Cell size is fundamental to cell physiology. For example, cell size determines the spatial scale of organelles and intracellular transport and thereby affects biosynthesis. Although some genes that affect mammalian cell size have been identified, the molecular mechanisms through which cell growth drives cell division have remained elusive. We show that cell growth during the G1 phase of the cell division cycle dilutes the cell cycle inhibitor Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to trigger division in human cells. RB overexpression increased cell size and G1 duration, whereas RB deletion decreased cell size and removed the inverse correlation between cell size at birth and the duration of the G1 phase. Thus, Rb dilution through cell growth in G1 provides one of the long-sought molecular mechanisms that promotes cell size homeostasis.

We identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting. Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters, while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters. The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size, and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number. Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control.},

In the Arabidopsis meristem, cell sizes are regularized despite asymmetric cell divisions. D'Ario et al. describe a balanced regulatory system that controls the duration of the growth phase of the cell cycle preceding DNA synthesis. KIP-related protein 4 (KRP4) inhibits progression to DNA synthesis. Because the amount of KRP4, which binds to mitotic chromosomes, is titrated to the amount of chromosomal DNA, daughter cells begin with similar amounts of KRP4 despite possible asymmetric cell divisions. Deviations are adjusted as excess KRP4 is degraded and the cell size is normalized.
Science, abb4348, this issue p. 1176
How eukaryotic cells assess and maintain sizes specific for their species and cell type remains unclear. We show that in the Arabidopsis shoot stem cell niche, cell size variability caused by asymmetric divisions is corrected by adjusting the growth period before DNA synthesis. KIP-related protein 4 (KRP4) inhibits progression to DNA synthesis and associates with mitotic chromosomes. The F BOX-LIKE 17 (FBL17) protein removes excess KRP4. Consequently, daughter cells are born with comparable amounts of KRP4. Inhibitor dilution models predicted that KRP4 inherited through chromatin would robustly regulate size, whereas inheritance of excess free KRP4 would disrupt size homeostasis, as confirmed by mutant analyses. We propose that a cell cycle regulator, stabilized by association with mitotic chromosomes, reads DNA content as a cell size–independent scale.

The main RBR protein domains and interactions with E2Fs are conserved in all eukaryotes and not only regulate the G1/S transition but also the G2/M transition, as part of DREAM complexes. RBR proteins are also important for asymmetric cell division, stem cell maintenance, and the DNA damage response (DDR). RBR proteins play crucial roles at every developmental phase transition, in association with chromatin factors, as well as during the reproductive phase during female and male gametes production and embryo development.

Consistently, several studies have revealed that large cells have lower mass accumulation rates per unit mass (i.e., growth efficiency) than intermediate-sized cells in the same population. Size-dependent growth is commonly attributed to transport limitations, such as increased diffusion timescales and decreased surface-to-volume ratio. However, separating cell size- and cell cycle-dependent growth is challenging. To address this, we monitored growth efficiency of pseudodiploid mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells during normal proliferation and polyploidization. This was enabled by the development of large-channel suspended microchannel resonators that allow us to monitor buoyant mass of single cells ranging from 40 pg (small pseudodiploid cell) to over 4,000 pg, with a resolution ranging from ∼1\% to ∼0.05\%. We find that cell growth efficiency increases, plateaus, and then decreases as cell cycle proceeds. This growth behavior repeats with every endomitotic cycle as cells grow into polyploidy. Overall, growth efficiency changes 33\% throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, increasing cell mass by over 100-fold during polyploidization did not change growth efficiency, indicating exponential growth. Consistently, growth efficiency remained constant when cell cycle was arrested in G
              2
              . Thus, cell cycle is a primary determinant of growth efficiency. As growth remains exponential over large size scales, our work finds no evidence for transport limitations that would decrease growth efficiency.},

          Cell size and biosynthesis are inextricably linked. As cells grow, total protein synthesis increases in proportion to cell size so that protein concentrations remain constant. As an exception, the budding yeast cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5 is synthesized in a constant amount per cell cycle, so that it is diluted in large cells to trigger division. Here, we show that this size-independent expression of Whi5 results from size-independent transcription. A screen for similar genes identified histones as the major class of size-independent transcripts during the cell cycle, consistent with histone synthesis being coupled to genome content rather than cell size. However, during asymmetric division size-independent transcription is insufficient for size-independent protein expression and chromatin-binding ensures equal amounts of protein are partitioned to unequally sized cells to maintain size-independent protein amounts. Thus, specific transcriptional and partitioning mechanisms determine size-independent protein expression to control cell size.},

Typically, in young and less differentiated tissues, a proliferative cell cycle mode occurs by which more cells are generated. As cells differentiate, the rate of cell proliferation decreases and eventually, cells exit the cell cycle.

Usually, in younger and less differentiated tissues, a proliferative cell cycle mode occurs. In this mitotic cell cycle program, DNA replication (also known as the synthesis or S phase) is followed by the segregation of the duplicated genetic material to two daughter cells in mitosis (M phase). Both the S and M phases are usually preceded by a preparative gap phase (G1 and G2 phase, respectively) during which cells monitor whether all conditions are favorable to continue a new round of DNA replication or mitosis. As cells differentiate, the rate of cell proliferation decreases. However, before complete withdrawal from the cell cycle and concomitant with differentiation, many plant cells switch from a mitotic cell cycle to an endoreduplication cycle (also called endocycle or endoreplication).

	abstract = {Intracarotid transplantation has shown potential for efficient stem cell delivery to the brain. However, reported complications, such as compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF), prompted us to perform further safety studies. Glial-restricted precursors (GRPs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted into the internal carotid artery of rats (n = 99), using a microcatheter. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect post-transplantation complications, including the development of stroke, for the following experimental variables: cell size, cell dose, cell infusion velocity, delay between artery occlusion and cell infusion, discordant versus concordant xenografting, and intracarotid transplantation with preserved versus compromised blood flow. Immunocompatibility and delayed infusion did not affect the number of complications. An infusion velocity over ≥1 mL/minute often resulted in stroke (27 out of 44 animals), even with an infusion of vehicle, whereas a lower velocity (0.2 mL/minute) was safe for the infusion of both vehicle and smaller cells (GRPs, diameter = 15 μm). Infusion of larger cells (MSCs, diameter = 25 μm) resulted in a profound decrease (75 ± 17\%) in CBF. Stroke lesions occurred frequently (12 out of 15 animals) when injecting 2 × 106 MSCs, but not after lowering the dose to 1 × 106 cells. The present results show that cell size and infusion velocity are critical factors in developing safe protocols for intracarotid stem cell transplantation.},

Ectopic activation of Myc has been recently suggested to regulate cell mass, and Drosophila dmyc controls cellular growth and size independently of cell division. By contrast, it has been proposed that in mammals Myc controls cell division and cell number. To gain insights into this debate we have specifically knocked out Myc in epidermis. Myc epidermal knockout mice are viable and their keratinocytes continue to cycle, but they display severe skin defects. The skin is tight and fragile, tears off in areas of mechanical friction and displays impaired wound healing. Steady-state epidermis is thinner, with loss of the proliferative compartment and premature differentiation. Remarkably, keratinocyte cell size, growth and endoreplication are reduced, and stem cell amplification is compromised. The results provide new and direct evidence for a role for endogenous Myc in cellular growth that is required for hyperproliferative cycles and tissue homeostasis.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitous small RNAs guiding post-transcriptional gene repression in countless biological processes. However, the miRNA pathway in mouse oocytes appears inactive and dispensable for development. We propose that marginalization of the miRNA pathway activity stems from the constraints and adaptations of RNA metabolism elicited by the diluting effects of oocyte growth. We report that miRNAs do not accumulate like mRNAs during the oocyte growth because miRNA turnover has not adapted to it. The most abundant miRNAs total tens of thousands of molecules in growing (∅ 40 μm) and fully grown (∅ 80 μm) oocytes, a number similar to that observed in much smaller fibroblasts. The lack of miRNA accumulation results in a 100-fold lower miRNA concentration in fully grown oocytes than in somatic cells. This brings a knock-down-like effect, where diluted miRNAs engage targets but are not abundant enough for significant repression. Low-miRNA concentrations were observed in rat, hamster, porcine and bovine oocytes, arguing that miRNA inactivity is not mouse-specific but a common mammalian oocyte feature. Injection of 250,000 miRNA molecules was sufficient to restore reporter repression in mouse and porcine oocytes, suggesting that miRNA inactivity comes from low-miRNA abundance and not from some suppressor of the pathway.},

	abstract = {Current knowledge of the mechanisms of cell migration is based on differentiated cells in culture where it is known that the actomyosin machinery drives migration via dynamic interactions with the extracellular matrix and adhesion complexes. However, unlike differentiated cells, cells in early metazoan embryos must also dynamically change cell sizes as they migrate. The relevance of cell size to cell migration and embryonic development is not known. Here we investigate this phenomena in zebrafish embryos, a model system in which reductive cell divisions causes cell sizes to decrease naturally over time as cells migrate collectively to sculpt the embryonic body plan. We show that cell size reduction during early development follows power-law scaling. Because mutations that can perturb cell sizes so early in development do not exist, we generate haploid and tetraploid zebrafish embryos and show that cell sizes in such embryos are smaller and larger than the diploid norm, respectively. Cells in embryos made of smaller or larger than normal cells migrate sub-optimally, leading to gastrulation defects. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the observed defects originate from altered cell size rather than from pleotropic effects of altered ploidy. This interpretation is strengthened by the result wherein restoring cell sizes to normal diploid-like values rescues gastrulation defects. Live imaging of chimeric embryos where haploid/tetraploid cells are introduced into diploid embryos reveal the cell-autonomous nature of the migration defects. Additionally, aberrant intracellular actin dynamics with respect to the vectorial direction of motion suggests a cellular mechanism behind the migration defects. Taken together, early reductive cell divisions potentially allow dynamic, stage-specific cell size norms to emerge, which enables efficient collective cell migration to correctly position cells in space and time to shape an amorphous ball of blastoderm into an embryo.},

In the Drosophila ventral furrow and other epithelia, apical constriction of hundreds of epithelial cells folds the tissue. Genes in the Gα12/13 pathway coordinate collective apical constriction, but the mechanism of coordination is poorly understood. Coupling live-cell imaging with a computational approach to identify contractile events, we discovered that differences in constriction behavior are biased by initial cell shape. Disrupting Gα12/13 exacerbates this relationship. Larger apical area is associated with delayed initiation of contractile pulses, lower apical E-cadherin and F-actin levels, and aberrantly mobile Rho-kinase structures. Our results suggest that loss of Gα12/13 disrupts apical actin cortex organization and pulse initiation in a sizedependent manner. We propose that Gα12/13 robustly organizes the apical cortex despite variation in apical area to ensure the timely initiation of contractile pulses in a tissue with heterogeneity in starting cell shape.},

In this report, we have used Coulter volume to determine the mean cell volume and diameter of normal human peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained by apheresis (HPC-A) from patients with hematological malignancies. Fresh peripheral blood samples (treated with Beckman Coulter IMMUNOPrep erythrocyte lysis solution), HPC-A samples (treated with BD Biosciences FACSLysing solution), or processed by Ficoll Hypaque sedimentation method were stained with CD45-FITC and PE-labeled CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133 antibodies and analyzed for electronic volume and two color fluorescence. The mean electronic volume and diameter of mononuclear cells from fresh peripheral blood samples prepared with IMMUNOPrep were lymphocytes (191 μm3, 7.16 μm), monocytes (370 μm3, 9.91 μm), and granulocytes (328 μm3, 8.56 μm). In mononuclear cells of HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation, the lymphocytes had volume and diameter of 311 μm3, 8.4 μm, monocytes were 486 μm3, 9.76 μm, and granulocytes were 515 μm3, 9.95 μm. In contrast, HPC-A samples prepared after lysis with FACSLysing solution had mean electronic volume and diameter of lymphocytes (414 μm3, 9.25 μm), monocytes (797 μm3, 11.5 μm), and granulocytes (670 μm3, 10.85 μm). Cell volume of mononuclear cells in the HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation method was correlated with the expression of stem cell markers CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133. CD90 positive cells had the smallest mean electronic volume of 299.93 μm3 when compared with cells with positive expression of CD133 (322 μm3), CD117 (349 μm3), CD34 (407 μm3), and CD45 (453 μm3).

Using flow cytometry we have identified two distinct subpopulations by size, large and small, within cultures of human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines. These two cell populations respond differentially to retinoic acid (RA) differentiation and several endocrine disruptor compounds (EDC). The large cell population responds to retinoic acid differentiation with greater than a 50\% reduction in cell number and loss of Oct-4 expression, whereas the number of the small cell population does not change and Oct-4 protein expression is maintained. In addition, four estrogenic compounds altered SSEA-3 expression differentially between the two cell subpopulations changing their ratios relative to each other. Both populations express stem cell markers Oct-4, Nanog, Tra-1–60, Tra-1–80 and SSEA-4, but express low levels of differentiation markers common to the three germ layers. Cloning studies indicate that both populations can revive the parental population. Furthermore, whole genome microarray identified approximately 400 genes with significantly different expression between the two populations (p{\textless}0.01). We propose the differential response to RA in these populations is due to differential gene expression of Notch signaling members, CoupTF1 and CoupTF2, chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes that render the small population resistant to RA differentiation. The findings that hES cells exist as heterogeneous populations with distinct responses to differentiation signals and environmental stimuli will be relevant for their use for drug discovery and disease therapy.},

Here, we show that NGN2-driven conversion of human embryonic stem cells to induced neurons (iNeurons) is associated with increased PINK1-independent mitophagic flux that is temporally correlated with metabolic reprogramming to support oxidative phosphorylation. Global multiplex proteomics during neurogenesis revealed large-scale remodeling of functional modules linked with pluripotency, mitochondrial metabolism, and proteostasis. Differentiation-dependent mitophagic flux required BNIP3L and its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, and BNIP3L also promoted mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons. Proteomic analysis of ATG12−/− iNeurons revealed accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and mitochondria during differentiation, indicative of widespread organelle remodeling during neurogenesis. This work reveals broad organelle remodeling of membrane-bound organelles during NGN2-driven neurogenesis via autophagy, identifies BNIP3L’s central role in programmed mitophagic flux, and provides a proteomic resource for elucidating how organelle remodeling and autophagy alter the proteome during changes in cell state.},

	abstract = {The presence of polyploid neurons in the vertebrate nervous system has been a subject of debate since the 1960s. At that time, Purkinje cells were proposed to be tetraploid, but technical limitations impeded to reach a clear conclusion, and the current belief is that most vertebrate neurons are diploid. By using up-to-date approaches we have recently demonstrated the existence of a subpopulation of tetraploid retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the vertebrate retina. In the chick, these neurons show large somas and extensive dendritic trees and most of them express a marker specific for RGCs innervating a specific lamina of the optic tectum. We have also demonstrated that these neurons are generated in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) acting through the neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), which induces E2F1 activity and cell cycle re-entry in migrating RGC neuroblasts lacking retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. We have also showed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prevents G2/M transition in the tetraploid RGCs, thus being crucial for the maintenance of the tetraploid status as well as the survival of these neurons. The realization that tetraploid neurons can be readily observed in the vertebrate nervous system has important physiological consequences, which are discussed in this commentary.},

As abnormal cell size may alter protein concentrations and cellular functionality, we used proteomic data from 59 unperturbed human cell lines to systematically characterize cell-size dependent changes in intracellular protein concentrations and organelle content. Increase in cell size leads to ubiquitous transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated reorganization and dilution of the proteome. Many known senescence proteins display disproportionate size-scaling consistent with their altered expression in senescent cells, while lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum expand in larger cells contributing to the senescence phenotype. Analysis of organelle proteome expression identifies p53 and retinoblastoma pathways as mediators of size-scaling, consistent with their role in senescence. Taken together, cell size can alter cellular fitness and function through cumulative reorganization of the proteome and organelle content. An extreme consequence of this pervasive size-scaling appears to be senescence.},

Growth, form, and function are all necessarily linked in cell biology, but we often do not understand the underlying molecular mechanisms nor their specific functions. Here, we review progress toward determining the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell size in yeast, animals, and plants, as well as progress toward understanding the function of cell size regulation. It has become increasingly clear that the mechanism of cell size regulation is deeply intertwined with basic mechanisms of biosynthesis, and how biosynthesis can be scaled (or not) in proportion to cell size. Finally, we highlight recent findings causally linking aberrant cell size regulation to cellular senescence and their implications for cancer therapies.

	abstract = {Cell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues, but it is unclear how deviations in cell size affect cell physiology. To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.},

Mature hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are one such in vitro model. Due to insufficiencies in transcriptome to proteome correlation, characterising the proteome of HLCs is essential to provide a suitable framework for their continual optimization. Here we interrogated the proteome during stepwise differentiation of hiPSCs into HLCs over 40 days. Whole cell protein lysates were collected and analysed using stabled isotope labelled mass spectrometry based proteomics. Quantitative proteomics identified over 6,000 proteins in duplicate multiplexed labelling experiments across two different time course series. Inductive cues in differentiation promoted sequential acquisition of hepatocyte specific markers. Analysis of proteins classically assigned as hepatic markers demonstrated trends towards maximum relative abundance between differentiation day 30 and 32. Characterisation of abundant proteins in whole cells provided evidence of the time dependent transition towards proteins corresponding with the functional repertoire of the liver. This data highlights how far the proteome of undifferentiated precursors have progressed to acquire a hepatic phenotype and constructs a platform for optimisation and improved maturation of HLC differentiation.},

Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ) is known to be a regulator of autoimmunity. Loss of TGFβ leads to severe multi-organ autoimmunity in mice. In skin, role of TGFβ in suppressing autoimmunity is unclear.
Objective
Determine whether Keratinocyte (KC)-derived TGFβ is required for skin immune homeostasis.
Methods
We generated K14-CreERT2 TGFβ1fl/fl (TGFβΔKC) mice allowing for tamoxifen-induced deletion of TGFβ1 in KC. The phenotype of skin was analyzed and compared to mice in which epidermal activation of TGFβ is impaired.
Results
KC was the major source of TGFβ in epidermis. Topical tamoxifen application led to efficient TGFβ1 deletion. The expected acanthosis was observed but no inflammatory infiltrate or altered numbers of resident immune cells were evident. Similarly, Itgb6−/− x K14Cre Itgb8f/f (Itgb6−/−Itgb8ΔKC) mice lacking both epidermal TGFβ-activating integrins showed no evidence of cutaneous inflammation.
Conclusions
KC-derived TGFβ and epidermal TGFβ activation are not required to suppress skin autoimmunity in steady state.},

	abstract = {Gene knockout technology has provided a powerful tool for functional analyses of genes expressed preferentially in a particular tissue. Given marked similarities between human and mouse skin, such studies with epidermally expressed genes have often provided valuable insights into human genetic skin disorders. Efficient silencing of a specified gene in a temporally regulated and epidermal-specific fashion could extend functional analyses to broadly expressed genes and increase the categories of human skin disorders to which parallels could be drawn. We have generated transgenic mice expressing Cre and a fusion protein between Cre recombinase and the tamoxifen responsive hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (CreERtam) under the control of the human keratin 14 (K14) promoter. This promoter is strongly active in dividing cells of epidermis and some other stratified squamous epithelia. With K14–Cre, transgenic embryos recombine genetically introduced loxP sequences efficiently and selectively in the genomes of keratinocytes that reside in embryonic day 14.5 skin, tongue, and esophagus. With K14–CreERtam, postnatal transgenic mice show no Cre activity until tamoxifen is administered. If orally administered, tamoxifen activates keratinocyte-specific CreERtam, allowing recombination of loxP sequences in epidermis, tongue, and esophagus. If topically administered, tamoxifen allows recombination in the area of skin where tamoxifen was applied. Finally, we show that epidermal cells harboring a Cre-dependent rearranged genome persist for many months after tamoxifen application, indicating that the epidermal stem cell population has been targeted efficiently. These tools now pave the way for testing the functional role of different somatic mutations that may exist in mosaic disorders of the skin, including squamous and basal cell carcinomas.},

However, skin soft tissue expansion is faced with many problems, such as long treatment process, poor skin quality, high retraction rate, and complications. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of skin soft tissue expansion is needed. The key to skin soft tissue expansion lies in the mechanical stretch applied to the skin by an inflatable expander. Mechanical stimulation activates multiple signaling pathways through cellular adhesion molecules and regulates gene expression profiles in cells. Meanwhile, various types of cells contribute to skin expansion, including keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, which are also regulated by mechanical stretch.

	abstract = {The mammalian skin is equipped with a highly dynamic stratified epithelium. The maintenance and regeneration of this epithelium is supported by basally located keratinocytes, which display stem cell properties, including lifelong proliferative potential and the ability to undergo diverse differentiation trajectories. Keratinocytes support not just the surface of the skin, called the epidermis, but also a range of ectodermal structures including hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Recent studies have shed light on the hitherto underappreciated heterogeneity of keratinocytes by employing state-of-the-art imaging technologies and single-cell genomic approaches. In this mini review, we highlight major recent discoveries that illuminate the dynamics and cellular mechanisms that govern keratinocyte differentiation in the live mammalian skin and discuss the broader implications of these findings for our understanding of epithelial and stem cell biology in general.},

This suggests the rate of these molecular processes is jointly regulated by an upstream, ultimate factor. Mitochondrial metabolism was recently proposed to act as an ultimate regulator by controlling the pace of protein synthesis upstream of developmental tempo. Alternative candidates for ultimate regulators include species-specific gene expression levels of factors involved in the central dogma, as well as species-specific cell size. Overall, much work remains to be done before we can confidently identify the ultimate causes of species-specific developmental rates.},

One possibility is that "cell-size checkpoints" act to delay division until cells have achieved a minimal size or mass however, the existence of such checkpoints in mammalian cells is controversial. In this study we provide further evidence against the operation of a size checkpoint in mammalian cells. We show that primary mammalian cells proliferate at a rate that is independent of cell size or cell mass and that cell size is "set" by the balance of extracellular growth factors and mitogens. Moreover, we show that commonly used culture conditions stimulate cell growth much more than cell cycle progression resulting in cells that proliferate at sizes 300-500\% larger than their in vivo counterparts. This has profound effects on cell behaviour.},

Although live imaging and cell tracking are powerful in providing direct evidence of cell coordination rules, extracting and comparing these rules across many tissues with potentially different length and timescales of coordination requires a versatile framework of analysis. Here we demonstrate that graph neural network (GNN) models are suited for this purpose, by showing how they can be applied to predict cell fate in tissues and utilized to infer the cell interactions governing the multicellular dynamics. Analyzing the live mammalian epidermis data, where spatiotemporal graphs constructed from cell tracks and cell contacts are given as inputs, GNN discovers distinct neighbor cell fate coordination rules that depend on the region of the body. This approach demonstrates how the GNN framework is powerful in inferring general cell interaction rules from live data without prior knowledge of the signaling involved.},

We, therefore, sought to test if the effects of the cell size on protein concentrations were also evident in single-cell proteomics data. Using the relative concentrations of a set of reference proteins to estimate a cell’s DNA-to-cell volume ratio, we found that differences in the cell size explain a significant amount of cell-to-cell variance in two published single-cell proteome data sets.},

The skin epidermis comprises mostly epithelial cells, but also harbours Langerhans cells (LCs) and dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs). Whether and how distributions of LCs and DETCs are regulated during homeostasis is unclear. Here, by tracking individual cells in the skin of live adult mice over time, we show that LCs and DETCs actively maintain a non-random spatial distribution despite continuous turnover of neighbouring basal epithelial cells. Moreover, the density of epithelial cells regulates the composition of LCs and DETCs in the epidermis. Finally, LCs require the GTPase Rac1 to maintain their positional stability, density and tiling pattern reminiscent of neuronal self-avoidance. We propose that these cellular mechanisms provide the epidermis with an optimal response to environmental insults.},

Our data revealed that harmonious growth is engineered by a single population of developmental progenitors presenting a fixed fate imbalance of self-renewing divisions with an ever-decreasing proliferation rate. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that epidermal developmental progenitors form a more uniform population compared with adult stem and progenitor cells. Finally, we found that the spatial pattern of cell division orientation is dictated locally by the underlying collagen fiber orientation. Our results uncover a simple design principle of organ growth where progenitors and differentiated cells expand in harmony with their surrounding tissues.},

	abstract = {Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process that requires activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Mouse models of human cancers have recently demonstrated that continuous expression of a dominantly acting oncogene (for example, Hras, Kras and Myc) is often required for tumour maintenance; this phenotype is referred to as oncogene addiction. This concept has received clinical validation by the development of active anticancer drugs that specifically inhibit the function of oncoproteins such as BCR-ABL, c-KIT and EGFR. Identifying additional gene mutations that are required for tumour maintenance may therefore yield clinically useful targets for new cancer therapies. Although loss of p53 function is a common feature of human cancers, it is not known whether sustained inactivation of this or other tumour suppressor pathways is required for tumour maintenance. To explore this issue, we developed a Cre-loxP-based strategy to temporally control tumour suppressor gene expression in vivo. Here we show that restoring endogenous p53 expression leads to regression of autochthonous lymphomas and sarcomas in mice without affecting normal tissues. The mechanism responsible for tumour regression is dependent on the tumour type, with the main consequence of p53 restoration being apoptosis in lymphomas and suppression of cell growth with features of cellular senescence in sarcomas. These results support efforts to treat human cancers by way of pharmacological reactivation of p53.},

In the adult skin epidermis, the stem cell compartment contains molecularly heterogeneous subpopulations1–4 whose relationship to the complete trajectory of differentiation remains unknown. Here we show that differentiation, from commitment to exit from the stem cell layer, is a multi-day process wherein cells transit through a continuum of transcriptional changes with upregulation of differentiation genes preceding downregulation of typical stemness genes. Differentiation-committed cells remain capable of dividing to produce daughter cells fated to further differentiate, demonstrating that differentiation is uncoupled from cell cycle exit. These cell divisions are not required as part of an obligate transit-amplifying programme but help to buffer the differentiating cell pool during heightened demand. Thus, instead of distinct contributions from multiple progenitors, a continuous gradual differentiation process fuels homeostatic epidermal turnover.},

Here we capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual epithelial behaviours by imaging wound re-epithelialization in live mice. Differentiated cells migrate while the rate of differentiation changes depending on local rate of migration and tissue architecture. Cells depart from a highly proliferative zone by directionally dividing towards the wound while collectively migrating. This regional coexistence of proliferation and migration leads to local expansion and elongation of the repairing epithelium. Finally, proliferation functions to pattern and restrict the recruitment of undamaged cells.

With the increased use of genetically engineered mice, there is a growing need for methods that can selectively visualize the morphologies of specified subsets of neurons. This capability is needed both to define cell morphologic phenotypes and to mark cells in a noninvasive manner for lineage studies. To this end, we describe a bipartite genetic system based on a Cre-estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein that irreversibly activates a plasma membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase reporter gene by site-specific recombination. Because the efficiency and timing of gene rearrangement is controlled pharmacologically, a sparse subset of labeled cells can be generated from the set of CreER-expressing cells at any time during development. Histochemical visualization of alkaline phosphatase activity reveals neuronal morphology with strong and uniform labeling of all processes.},

Mouse models of human cancer often rely on germline alterations that activate or inactivate genes of interest. One limitation of this approach is that germline mutations might have effects other than somatic mutations, owing to developmental compensation2,3. To model sporadic cancers associated with inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumour suppressor gene in humans, we have produced a conditional allele of the mouse Rb gene. We show here that acute loss of Rb in primary quiescent cells is sufficient for cell cycle entry and has phenotypic consequences different from germline loss of Rb function. This difference is explained in part by functional compensation by the Rb-related gene p107. We also show that acute loss of Rb in senescent cells leads to reversal of the cellular senescence programme. Thus, the use of conditional knockout strategies might refine our understanding of gene function and help to model human cancer more accurately.},

The embryonic lethality of Rb-null animals restricts the phenotypic analysis of these mice to mid-gestation embryogenesis. We employed the Cre/loxP system to study the function of Rb in adult mouse stratified epithelium. RbF19/F19;K14cre mice displayed hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with increased proliferation and aberrant expression of differentiation markers. In vitro, pRb is essential for the maintainance of the postmitotic state of terminally differentiated keratinocytes, preventing cell cycle re-entry. However, p107 compensates for the effects of Rb loss as the phenotypic abnormalities of RbF19/F19;K14cre keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro become more severe with the concurrent loss of p107 alleles. p107 alone appears to be dispensable for all these phenotypic changes, as the presence of a single Rb allele in a p107-null background rescues all these alterations. Luciferase reporter experiments indicate that these phenotypic alterations might be mediated by increased E2F activity. Our findings support a model in which pRb in conjunction with p107 plays a central role in regulating epidermal homeostasis.},

            Organoids provide an accessible in vitro system to mimic the dynamics of tissue regeneration and development. However, long-term live-imaging of organoids remains challenging. Here we present an experimental and image-processing framework capable of turning long-term light-sheet imaging of intestinal organoids into digital organoids. The framework combines specific imaging optimization combined with data processing via deep learning techniques to segment single organoids, their lumen, cells and nuclei in 3D over long periods of time. By linking lineage trees with corresponding 3D segmentation meshes for each organoid, the extracted information is visualized using a web-based “Digital Organoid Viewer” tool allowing combined understanding of the multivariate and multiscale data. We also show backtracking of cells of interest, providing detailed information about their history within entire organoid contexts. Furthermore, we show cytokinesis failure of regenerative cells and that these cells never reside in the intestinal crypt, hinting at a tissue scale control on cellular fidelity.},

Consequently, daughter cells are born with comparable amounts of KRP4. Inhibitor dilution models predicted that KRP4 inherited through chromatin would robustly regulate size, whereas inheritance of excess free KRP4 would disrupt size homeostasis, as confirmed by mutant analyses. We propose that a cell cycle regulator, stabilized by association with mitotic chromosomes, reads DNA content as a cell size–independent scale.},

We review basic concepts and players in plant cell cycle and division, and then focus on their links to growth-related cues, such as metabolic state, cell size, cell geometry, and cell mechanics, and on how cell cycle progression and cell division are linked to speciﬁc cell fates. The retinoblastoma pathway has emerged as a major player in the coordination of the cell cycle with both growth and cell identity, while microtubule dynamics are central in the coordination of oriented cell divisions. Future challenges include clarifying feedbacks between growth and cell cycle progression, revealing the molecular basis of cell division orientation in response to mechanical and chemical signals, and probing the links between cell fate changes and chromatin dynamics during the cell cycle.},

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue in adult mammals. We have recently shown that Lgr5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor) is expressed in intestinal stem cells by an in vivo genetic lineage tracing strategy. In the past, extensive efforts have been made to establish primary small intestinal culture systems. However, no defined, reproducible and robust culture system had been developed. To establish such a system, we screened for optimal growth factor combinations based on genetic evidence of self-renewal regulation, differentiation, and carcinogenesis of intestinal stem cells. Here, we describe methods that we have established for the isolation and culture of primary small intestinal epithelial stem cells. In this culture system, isolated crypts form “organoid structures” with a histological hierarchy recapitulating in vivo small intestinal epithelium. Single isolated Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells also form these organoid structures, in which stem cells are maintained by self-renewal and give rise to all lineages of the intestinal epithelium. This culture system is particularly useful for studying the regulation of intestinal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Lentivirus-based gene delivery works efficiently for the majority of mammalian cells cultured under standard two-dimensional conditions. By contrast, intestinal epithelial organoids embedded into three-dimensional extracellular matrix appear to be resistant to lentiviral transduction. We observed that Matrigel, a matrix that reconstitutes a basement membrane and is indispensable for cell survival and proliferation, prevents lentiviruses from binding to intestinal cells. In this chapter, we describe a simple method of a highly efficient gene transduction into intestinal organoids. This method involves organoid dispersion into single intestinal epithelial cells, mixing these individual cells with lentiviral particles, plating on Matrigel, and subsequent re-embedding into Matrigel. Under these conditions, the majority of the cells are exposed to the virus in the absence of the matrix barrier while remaining attached to the matrix. Using a GFP-labeled lentivirus, we demonstrate that this method allows for highly efficient infection of intestinal organoids after overnight incubation of Matrigel-attached cells with lentiviral particles.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Detailed descriptions of cell lineages and behaviors provide a powerful framework to elucidate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. To study the cellular basis of limb development, we imaged transgenic fluorescently-labeled embryos from the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis with multi-view light-sheet microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution over several days of embryogenesis. The cell lineage of outgrowing thoracic limbs was reconstructed at single-cell resolution with new software called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT). In silico clonal analyses suggested that the early limb primordium becomes subdivided into anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb-bud formation is associated with spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by preferential orientation of cell divisions along the proximal-distal growth axis. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic.},

	abstract = {Many biological applications require the segmentation of cell bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current methods are specialized for images that have large training datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments. Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly. Cellpose is a generalist, deep learning-based approach for segmenting structures in a wide range of image types. Cellpose does not require parameter adjustment or model retraining and outperforms established methods on 2D and 3D datasets.},

It is increasingly clear that cell size is determined by size checkpoints—mechanisms that restrict the cell cycle progression of cells that are smaller than their target size. Previously, we described a p38 MAPK-dependent cell size checkpoint mechanism whereby p38 is selectively activated and prevents cell cycle progression in cells that are smaller than a given target size. In this study, we show that the specific target size required for inactivation of p38 and transition through the cell cycle is determined by CDK4 activity. Our data suggest a model whereby p38 and CDK4 cooperate analogously to the function of a thermostat: while p38 senses irregularities in size, CDK4 corresponds to the thermostat dial that sets the target size.},

Yet, despite their widespread relevance, the relation between cell size and count has never been formally examined over the whole human body. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of cell size and count over all major cell types, with data drawn from {\textgreater}1,500 published sources. We consider the body of a representative male (70 kg), which allows further estimates of a female (60 kg) and 10-y-old child (32 kg). We build a hierarchical interface for the cellular organization of the body, giving easy access to data, methods, and sources (https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/). In total, we estimate total body counts of ≈36 trillion cells in the male, ≈28 trillion in the female, and ≈17 trillion in the child. These data reveal a surprising inverse relation between cell size and count, implying a trade-off between these variables, such that all cells within a given logarithmic size class contribute an equal fraction to the body’s total cellular biomass. We also find that the coefficient of variation is approximately independent of mean cell size, implying the existence of cell-size regulation across cell types. Our data serve to establish a holistic quantitative framework for the cells of the human body, and highlight large-scale patterns in cell biology.},

Using the D. melanogaster wing disc as model, we find that populations of iECs initially increase in size but then subsequently undergo a heterogenous arrest that causes severe tissue undergrowth. iECs acquired DNA damage and activated a Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, but, unlike other stressed cells, were apoptosis-resistant and not eliminated from the epithelium. Instead, iECs entered a JNK-dependent and reversible senescent-like arrest. Senescent iECs promoted division of diploid neighbors, but this compensatory proliferation did not rescue tissue growth. Our study has uncovered unique attributes of iECs and their effects on tissue growth that have important implications for understanding their roles in wound healing and cancer.},

A convergence of recent and historical studies suggest - just as a thermostat maintains room temperature - the size of proliferating animal cells is similarly maintained by homeostatic mechanisms. In this review, we first summarize old and new literature on the existence of cell size checkpoints, then discuss additional advances in the study of size homeostasis that involve feedback regulation of cellular growth rate. We further discuss recent progress on the molecules that underlie cell size checkpoints and mechanisms that specify target size setpoints. Lastly, we discuss a less-well explored teleological question: why does cell size matter and what is the functional importance of cell size control?},

Signal transduction not only initiates entry into the cell cycle, but also reprograms cellular metabolism. This instructional metabolic reprogramming is critical if the cell is to fulfill the anabolic and energetic requirements that accompany cell growth and division. Growth factor signaling mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major role in regulating the cellular uptake of glucose, as well as the incorporation of this glucose carbon into lipids for membrane synthesis. Tyrosine-kinase-based regulation of key glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase also plays a critical role directing glucose carbon into anabolic pathways. In addition, the Myc transcription factor and mTOR kinase regulate the uptake and utilization of amino acids for protein and nucleic acid synthesis, as well as for the supply of intermediates to the mitochondrial Krebs cycle. However, the relationship between cellular signaling and metabolism is not unidirectional. Cells, by sensing levels of intracellular metabolites and the status of key metabolic pathways, can exert feedback control on signal transduction networks through multiple types of metabolite-derived protein modifications. These mechanisms allow cells to coordinate growth and division with their metabolic activity.},

	abstract = {Before a cell divides into two daughter cells, it typically doubles not only its DNA, but also its mass. Numerous studies in cells ranging from yeast to mammals have shown that cellular growth, stimulated by nutrients and/or growth factor signaling, is a prerequisite for cell cycle progression in most types of cells. The textbook view of growth-regulated cell cycles is that growth signaling activates the transcription of G1 Cyclin genes to induce cell proliferation, and also stimulates anabolic metabolism and cell growth in parallel. However, genetic knockout tests in model organisms indicate that this is not the whole story, and new studies show that additional, “smarter” mechanisms help to coordinate the cell cycle with growth itself. Here we summarize recent advances in this field, and discuss current models in which growth signaling regulates cell proliferation by targeting core cell cycle regulators via non-transcriptional mechanisms.},

However, such size scaling remains poorly understood as it applies to cell mechanics and mechanosensing. By examining how the Drosophila pupal dorsal thorax epithelium responds to morphogenetic forces, we found that the number of apical stress fibers (aSFs) anchored to adherens junctions scales with cell apical area to limit larger cell elongation under mechanical stress. aSFs cluster Hippo pathway components, thereby scaling Hippo signaling and proliferation with area. This scaling is promoted by tricellular junctions mediating an increase in aSF nucleation rate and lifetime in larger cells. Development, homeostasis, and repair entail epithelial cell size changes driven by mechanical forces; our work highlights how, in turn, mechanosensitivity scales with cell size.},

Cell geometry controls cell-cycle progression and mitosis and thus modulates tissue development and homeostasis. In sharp contrast and despite the extensive characterization of the genetic mechanisms of caspase activation, we know little about whether and how cell geometry controls apoptosis commitment in developing tissues. Here, we combined multiscale time-lapse microscopy of developing Drosophila epithelium, quantitative characterization of cell behaviors, and genetic and mechanical perturbations to determine how apoptosis is controlled during epithelial tissue development. We found that early in cell lives and well before extrusion, apoptosis commitment is linked to two distinct geometric features: a small apical area compared with other cells within the tissue and a small relative apical area with respect to the immediate neighboring cells. We showed that these global and local geometric characteristics are sufficient to recapitulate the tissue-scale apoptotic pattern. Furthermore, we established that the coupling between these two geometric features and apoptotic cells is dependent on the Hippo/YAP and Notch pathways. Overall, by exploring the links between cell geometry and apoptosis commitment, our work provides important insights into the spatial regulation of cell death in tissues and improves our understanding of the mechanisms that control cell number and tissue size.},

However, it has remained unclear whether and how signaling depends on contact geometry. This question is particularly relevant for Notch signaling, which coordinates neighboring cell fates through direct cell-cell signaling. Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This relationship extends across contact diameters ranging from micrometers to tens of micrometers. Mathematical modeling predicts that dependence of signaling on contact area can bias cellular differentiation in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition processes, such that smaller cells are more likely to differentiate into signal-producing cells. Consistent with this prediction, analysis of developing chick inner ear revealed that ligand-producing hair cell precursors have smaller apical footprints than non-hair cells. Together, these results highlight the influence of cell morphology on fate determination processes.},

	abstract = {Cell fate determination by lateral inhibition via Notch/Delta signalling has been extensively studied. Most formalised models consider Notch/Delta interactions in fields of cells, with parameters that typically lead to symmetry breaking of signalling states between neighbouring cells, commonly resulting in salt-and-pepper fate patterns. Here, we consider the case of signalling between isolated cell pairs, and find that the bifurcation properties of a standard mathematical model of lateral inhibition can lead to stable symmetric signalling states. We apply this model to the adult intestinal stem cell (ISC) of Drosophila, the fate of which is stochastic but dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. We observe a correlation between signalling state in cell pairs and their contact area. We interpret this behaviour in terms of the properties of our model in the presence of population variability in contact areas, which affects the effective signalling threshold of individual cells. Our results suggest that the dynamics of Notch/Delta signalling can contribute to explain stochasticity in stem cell fate decisions, and that the standard model for lateral inhibition can account for a wider range of developmental outcomes than previously considered.},

	abstract = {Every type of cell in an animal maintains a specific size, which likely contributes to its ability to perform its physiological functions. While some cell size control mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured cells, it is unclear if and how such mechanisms control cell size in an animal. For example, it was recently shown that RB, the retinoblastoma protein, was diluted by cell growth in G1 to promote size-dependence of the G1/S transition. However, it remains unclear to what extent the RB-dilution mechanism controls cell size in an animal. We therefore examined the contribution of RB-dilution to cell size control in the mouse liver. Consistent with the RB-dilution model, genetic perturbations decreasing RB protein concentrations through inducible shRNA expression or through liver-specific Rb1 knockout reduced hepatocyte size, while perturbations increasing RB protein concentrations in an Fah-/- mouse model increased hepatocyte size. Moreover, RB concentration reflects cell size in G1 as it is lower in larger G1 hepatocytes. In contrast, concentrations of the cell cycle activators Cyclin D1 and E2f1 were relatively constant. Lastly, loss of Rb1 weakened cell size control, i.e., reduced the inverse correlation between how much cells grew in G1 and how large they were at birth. Taken together, our results show that an RB-dilution mechanism contributes to cell size control in the mouse liver by linking cell growth to the G1/S transition.},

	abstract = {Reaction–diffusion networks underlie pattern formation in a range of biological contexts, from morphogenesis of organisms to the polarization of individual cells. One requirement for such molecular networks is that output patterns be scaled to system size. At the same time, kinetic properties of constituent molecules constrain the ability of networks to adapt to size changes. Here, we explore these constraints and the consequences thereof within the conserved PAR cell polarity network. Using the stem-cell-like germ lineage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo as a model, we find that the behaviour of PAR proteins fails to scale with cell size. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this lack of scaling results in a size threshold below which polarity is destabilized, yielding an unpolarized system. In empirically constrained models, this threshold occurs near the size at which germ lineage cells normally switch between asymmetric and symmetric modes of division. Consistent with cell size limiting polarity and division asymmetry, genetic or physical reduction in germ lineage cell size is sufficient to trigger loss of polarity in normally polarizing cells at predicted size thresholds. Physical limits of polarity networks may be one mechanism by which cells read out geometrical features to inform cell fate decisions.},

Through computational simulation, we demonstrate that this cell size–mediated transition allows robust, yet flexible termination of stem cell proliferation, and we observe adjustments in the number of divisions before the differentiation threshold under several genetic manipulations. We experimentally evaluate several mechanisms for cell size sensing, and our data suggest that this stomatal lineage transition is dependent on a nuclear factor that is sensitive to DNA content.},

Inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II)–driven apical constriction altered ISC shape and reduced niche curvature and stem cell capacity. Niche curvature is decreased in aged mice, suggesting that suboptimal interactions between old ISCs and their niche develop with age. We show that activation of NM IIC or physical restriction to young topology improves in vitro regeneration by old epithelium.

The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas) proliferates using a multiple fission cell cycle that involves a long G1 phase followed by a rapid series of successive S and M phases (S/M) that produces 2n daughter cells. Two control points show cell-size dependence: the Commitment control point in mid-G1 phase requires the attainment of a minimum size to enable at least one mitotic division during S/M, and the S/M control point where mother cell size governs cell division number (n), ensuring that daughter distributions are uniform. tny1 mutants pass Commitment at a smaller size than wild type and undergo extra divisions during S/M phase to produce small daughters, indicating that TNY1 functions to inhibit size-dependent cell cycle progression. TNY1 encodes a cytosolic hnRNP A-related RNA binding protein and is produced once per cell cycle during S/M phase where it is apportioned to daughter cells, and then remains at constant absolute abundance as cells grow, a property known as subscaling. Altering the dosage of TNY1 in heterozygous diploids or through mis-expression increased Commitment cell size and daughter cell size, indicating that TNY1 is a limiting factor for both size control points. Epistasis placed TNY1 function upstream of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor complex (RBC) and one of its regulators, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase G1 (CDKG1). Moreover, CDKG1 protein and mRNA were found to over-accumulate in tny1 cells suggesting that CDKG1 may be a direct target of repression by TNY1. Our data expand the potential roles of subscaling proteins outside the nucleus and imply a control mechanism that ties TNY1 accumulation to pre-division mother cell size.},

Using NoRI, we demonstrate that protein, lipid, and water concentrations at the single cell are maintained in a tight range in cells under the same physiological conditions and are altered in different physiological states, such as cell cycle stages, attachment to substrates of different stiffness, or by entering senescence. In animal tissues, protein and lipid concentration varies with cell types, yet an unexpected cell-to-cell heterogeneity was found in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The protein and lipid concentration profile provides means to quantitatively compare disease-related pathology, as demonstrated using models of Alzheimer’s disease. This demonstration shows that NoRI is a broadly applicable technique for probing the biological regulation of protein mass, lipid mass, and water mass for studies of cellular and tissue growth, homeostasis, and disease.},

	abstract = {To achieve a stable size distribution over multiple generations, proliferating cells require a means of counteracting stochastic noise in the rate of growth, the time spent in various phases of the cell cycle, and the imprecision in the placement of the plane of cell division. In the most widely accepted model, cell size is thought to be regulated at the G1/S transition, such that cells smaller than a critical size pause at the end of G1 phase until they have accumulated mass to a predetermined size threshold, at which point the cells proceed through the rest of the cell cycle. However, a model, based solely on a specific size checkpoint at G1/S, cannot readily explain why cells with deficient G1/S control mechanisms are still able to maintain a very stable cell size distribution. Furthermore, such a model would not easily account for stochastic variation in cell size during the subsequent phases of the cell cycle, which cannot be anticipated at G1/S. To address such questions, we applied computationally enhanced quantitative phase microscopy (ceQPM) to populations of cultured human cell lines, which enables highly accurate measurement of cell dry mass of individual cells throughout the cell cycle. From these measurements, we have evaluated the factors that contribute to maintaining cell mass homeostasis at any point in the cell cycle. Our findings reveal that cell mass homeostasis is accurately maintained, despite disruptions to the normal G1/S machinery or perturbations in the rate of cell growth. Control of cell mass is generally not confined to regulation of the G1 length. Instead mass homeostasis is imposed throughout the cell cycle. In the cell lines examined, we find that the coefficient of variation (CV) in dry mass of cells in the population begins to decline well before the G1/S transition and continues to decline throughout S and G2 phases. Among the different cell types tested, the detailed response of cell growth rate to cell mass differs. However, in general, when it falls below that for exponential growth, the natural increase in the CV of cell mass is effectively constrained. We find that both mass-dependent cell cycle regulation and mass-dependent growth rate modulation contribute to reducing cell mass variation within the population. Through the interplay and coordination of these 2 processes, accurate cell mass homeostasis emerges. Such findings reveal previously unappreciated and very general principles of cell size control in proliferating cells. These same regulatory processes might also be operative in terminally differentiated cells. Further quantitative dynamical studies should lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of cell size control.},

	abstract = {Cell growth and division must be coordinated to maintain a stable cell size, but how this coordination is implemented in multicellular tissues remains unclear. In unicellular eukaryotes, autonomous cell size control mechanisms couple cell growth and division with little extracellular input. However, in multicellular tissues we do not know if autonomous cell size control mechanisms operate the same way or whether cell growth and cell cycle progression are separately controlled by cell-extrinsic signals. Here, we address this question by tracking single epidermal stem cells growing in adult mice. We find that a cell-autonomous size control mechanism, dependent on the RB pathway, sets the timing of S phase entry based on the cell’s current size. Cell-extrinsic variations in the cellular microenvironment affect cell growth rates but not this autonomous coupling. Our work reassesses long-standing models of cell cycle regulation within complex metazoan tissues and identifies cell-autonomous size control as a critical mechanism regulating cell divisions in vivo and thereby a major contributor to stem cell heterogeneity.},
